A Look at the New DNR Act


he Pennsylvania Department of Health has adopted final amendments for Act 59, which is the Advance Directive for Health Care Act and the Do-Not-Resuscitate Act. The final regulations deal with general rules for the issuance, administration and revocation of out-of-hospital DNR orders, including those for pregnant patients. 
The amendments to the Advance Directive Act provide revised requirements for when EMS personnel are to implement a patient’s advance declaration directing that the patient not be resuscitated. The DNR Act establishes standards for and procedures by which a patient’s attending physician may provide a patient with an out-of-hospital DNR order, bracelet or necklace that EMS personnel are to honor. 
The new regulations direct EMS providers on procedures for imple­menting an out-of-hospital DNR order when a patient experiences cardiac or respiratory arrest. Under the DNR Act, the EMS provider is empowered to withhold CPR upon observing an out-of-hospital DNR order, bracelet or necklace displayed by the patient. Also, the EMS provider is not required to contact a medical command physician to secure approval. 
This change in regulation differs from the Advance Directive for Health Care Act where EMS providers cannot follow the directive until a medical command physician, who determines the directive is operative and directs to withhold or discontinue CPR, gives approval.

New DNR Act continued from cover 
In the event a patient has both a DNR order and an Advance Directive, the new regulations state that the EMS provider is to follow the procedure for complying with the out-of-hospital DNR order. 
Under the new DNR Act, the following procedures should take place for out-of-hospital DNR orders: 
•	
Patients who are diagnosed with a terminal illness will be issued an out-of-hospital DNR order and possibly a bracelet or necklace by their attending physician. These direct an EMS provider to withhold providing CPR to the patient in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest. 

•	
The patient must possess and display the order, bracelet or necklace when under the care of an EMS provider. A patient’s surrogate may also present the EMS provider with an out-of-hospital DNR order for the patient. 


•	
The patient or surrogate may revoke the DNR order without a physician’s approval or knowledge by conveying the decision verbally or otherwise at the time of respiratory or cardiac arrest. 

•	
EMS providers may administer CPR if the provider is uncertain of the validity or applicability of the DNR, bracelet or necklace. 

•	
An EMS provider who complies with the patient’s out-of-hospital DNR order may provide other medical intervention to the patient for comfort or to alleviate pain. 

•	
If a patient is pregnant at the time of cardiac or respiratory arrest, life­sustaining treatment, CPR, nutrition and hydration will be provided unless the patient’s physician and obstetrician have certified that such treatment will be physically harmful to the pregnant patient, will not maintain the pregnant patient in a way to permit the continuing devel­opment and live birth of the unborn child, or will cause pain to the patient that cannot be alleviated by medication. 

Some other updates and regulations approved in Act 59 include: 

•	
Physicians are required to discuss the DNR Act with appropriate patients and secure out-of-hospital 


Physicians are required to maintain a copy of the order in the patient’s medical record. 
•	
EMS providers are to comply with out-of-hospital DNR orders issued in another states if that state’s orders, bracelets and necklace are consistent with Pennsylvania law. The DOH will issue a list of other states with orders, bracelets and necklaces that are acceptable in Pennsylvania. 

•	
If CPR has been initiated for the patient before a pre-hospital practitioner arrives on the scene, and the pre­hospital practitioner determines a DNR order is effective, the prehospital practitioner may not continue CPR without being directed to do so by a medical command physician. 


In the coming weeks, ambulance services will be required to have written policies and procedures on this Act. Additional time will be given to adopt these policies and procedures. Regulations will also be ineffective until DNR orders, bracelets and necklaces are available. 
Curricula for securing prehospital certi­fications and recognitions will also be modified to include the requirements in the future. The DOH will be developing an out-of-hospital DNR order form for physicians as well as a process for filing on paper or electronically.

DOH Announces Smallpox Vaccination Plan


hile professionals at hospitals and health care facilities nationwide gear up and begin offering smallpox vaccinations to its workers, EMS and other first responder personnel are on standby to implement a future plan for inoculation. 
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) began Stage 1 of smallpox vaccinations earlier this year on emer­gency, health care workers and other official personnel who have volunteered to be a part of the Smallpox Response Teams. In Stage 2, EMS personnel, fire­fighters and law enforcement personnel will be for eligible for vaccinations. The HHS reports that the United States has sufficient quantities of the vaccine to inoculate every single American should such an emergency occur. 
According to the Pennsylvania Department of Health Smallpox Vaccination Plan, smallpox is a serious illness that is caused by the variola virus and is spread from person to person through close contact. The disease can cause a severe rash, high fever, tiredness, severe headaches and backaches, blindness and death in up to 30 percent of those infected. Because of its high fatality rates and transmissibility, smallpox is one of the most serious bioterrorist threats to the civilian population. 
In the United States, the general popula­tion has not been vaccinated during the past 30 years. This fact, coupled with the fatality rate and the lack of real treatment for victims, has prompted the Federal and State governments to issue plans for dealing with an outbreak of 



smallpox

the disease both pre-event and post­event. According to the HHS, the smallpox vaccine is highly effective protection against the disease when given before or shortly after exposure to the virus. 
Should a confirmed smallpox outbreak occur, it may be necessary to vaccinate a large population quickly and treat those with the disease while containing it to keep from further contamination of individuals. According to the plan, smallpox vaccination clinics will be set up and facilities identified to handle those individuals with the disease. Because of the risks, EMS and other personnel who could potentially transfer patients to these designated sites should be vaccinated prior to any outbreak in order to receive protection from exposure. 
Once vaccinated, individuals are advised to avoid contact transmission of the disease and keep the vaccination site covered to keep from transmitting the vaccina. In addition, care must be taken to keep all materials that may be contaminated separate from general areas, placed in biohazard containers, and treated as infectious waste. The vaccina virus can be spread as soon as the second post vaccination day until the scab penetrates the skin at about 14 to 21 days. 
Reaction to the vaccine can include soreness at the vaccination site, intense erythema ringing the vaccination site, malaise, lymphadenopathy, myalgia, headache, chills, nausea, fatigue and fever. The vaccine is considered generally safe, according to the DOH report. A small number of adverse reactions may occur with a rare occurrence of serious or life threatening complications. It is anticipated, according to the DOH, that one in three of the recipients of the vaccine may miss one or more days of work and that there will be 14 to 52 serious reactions per one million recip­ients. Approximately one in one million recipients will die from the reactions. 
The adverse effects of the vaccine are often cited as a reason for individuals declining the injection of the smallpox vaccine. However, statistics from the Department of Health show that the death rate for the disease is 30 percent while the death rate for the vaccine is one in 1 million and one in 4 million for those who have been previously vaccinated. 
The HHS and the Justice Department are reviewing liability coverage. In addition, the Center for Disease Control is working on developing statistical profiling to follow employees who are

New Accident Form Developed

The Pennsylvania Department of Health has developed a form for reporting vehicular accidents involving ambulances. This form, which is similar to police forms for reporting accidents, must be completed and reported within 24 hours of an accident. Fatalities must be reported within eight hours. 
Forms can be submitted online; however, a signed form must be printed and mailed to the regional office for the permanent file. For more information on completing the new form, or for a copy of the form, visit the EMSI website at www.emsi04.org. 



Kevin A. Lipscomb Named EMSI Assistant Executive Director

A Reminder:

EOAs No Longer
Approved Devices
for ALS Providers


ast year, the Pennsylvania Department of Health deleted the Esophageal Obturator Airway (EOA) as an approved device for ALS providers. Recently, the Emergency Medical Services Office completed a review of 2001-02 Patient Care Reports and found that ambulance services may still be using EOAs in violation of the policy. 
All ambulance services are reminded that an EOA is no longer an approved device for ALS personnel and must not be used. Services should check to be sure that the entries on trip sheets are recorded correctly; although there is a block on the trip sheet for this entry, EOAs should not be used or checked. 
Also, the affiliate number listed should be checked to be sure it corresponds to a BLS service and that the affiliate num­ber listed does not correspond to any ambulance service. In addition, all licensure coordinators should routinely check vehicles as part of the inspection process to ensure that EOAs are not present. 
For more information on the EOA dele­tion or potential errors in reporting on trip sheets, contact Robert H. Gaumer, EMS program specialist, Emergency Medical Service Office, at rgaumer@state.pa.us. 

Computerized System Now Available for



Continuing Education Training



MS personnel who want to receive continuing education training are just a click away from a new system that allows individuals to take classes from their e-mail enabled computer system. The new program is being offered by the Pennsylvania Department of Health. 
Entitled the Learning Management System (LMS), this new program pro­vides content on a number of topics, including Pennsylvania’s smallpox plan, the Pennsylvania National Pharmaceutical Stockpile Plan, Pennsylvania’s Laboratory Network, Disaster Nursing, Health Alert Network, and the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System. At this time, continuing education credits are not available for online education efforts through the LMS. This valuable credit is planned to be available in the future. 
The system requires a sound card for participants to hear the audio portion of the classes. Funding is available through EMSI to purchase up to 100 sound cards for services that currently have a computer base, but lack the ability to hear the audio portion of the presentations. 
The DOH has allocated 20,000 sub­scriptions for EMS personnel, with dis­tribution completed on a first-come first-served basis. Subscriptions will not be based on regional EMS council basis. Subscribers are limited to one user ID and password; persons with dual certification (EMT and paramedic) 

Remember to Return Your Paramedic Survey 

aramedics in the region are encouraged to complete and return the Department of Health survey that was recently mailed to a number of professionals. The survey seeks pertinent information on recruitment and retention problems with paramedics in the area. 
The survey was due by March 15. If you received the survey and have not yet completed it, please do so as soon as possible and return it to the proper personnel. Your responses are vital to assessing the problems in the system so solutions can be discussed and implemented. 
For more information on the survey, contact EMSI at (412) 242-7322. 
must choose which certification they will use. 
Individual practitioners may sign up for this service through EMSI, which will in turn compile the information and submit it to the state EMS office. 
Anyone interested in learning more about the Learning Management System or purchasing sound cards should contact Phil Stoner, executive director, EMSI, at (412) 242-7322. Also, suggestions for future programs and presenters are being sought. Anyone with ideas should contact Gail Dubs at sdubs@state.pa.us.

Grants for Communications Results Announced 

he Pennsylvania Department of Health has announced the results of its Grants for Communications program. EMSI’s region will receive approximately $113,000 of the $1 million in grant money for communications awarded this year. Of that amount, $50,000 will be used to replace old equipment at the Eastern Regional dispatch center that used to be housed in Forbes Regional Hospital. The remaining $63,000 will be used to replace old equipment and improve coverage in Greene County. 
Future grants, which can be up to three years in duration, will focus on the following priorities: 
•
 Replacement of equipment withparts that are unavailable due to age. 

•
 Replacement/additions of equipmentwhere there are currently identified holes in the coverage afforded by the present equipment. This can include holes in coverage if services have to go outside their normal service area in response to a request for mutual aid. 

•
 New technology. 


For more information on the grants and their funding guidelines, contact Phil Stoner, executive director, EMSI, at (412) 242-7322.

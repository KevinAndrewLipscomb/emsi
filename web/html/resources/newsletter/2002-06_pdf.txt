University of Pittsburgh Studies Prehospital Airway Management Practices 

irway management is probably the most important procedure that EMS professionals can perform in the field. If completed correctly, it can save lives. If done incorrectly, there is significant risk for catastrophic results. 
Because of its importance, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Department of Emergency Medicine developed the Prehospital Airway Collaborative Evaluation (PACE) to study prehospital airway management practices. This was the first study of its type to look at airway management performed by multiple sites. Past studies typically focused on single systems and did not look closely at performance, according to Henry Wang, MD, research fellow, department of Emergency Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. 
In Phase I of PACE, which took place from June 1 through November 30, 2001, Dr. Wang’s team began the study of multiple sites in the area. During this time, 45 EMS systems from across Pennsylvania collected data after every intubation attempt. The study asked pre­hospital personnel to complete a data form that included information on patient demographics, clinical factors, physiological parameters, intubation methods, difficulties and complications encountered, and outcomes. Data were collected on almost 750 adult intubations,

Airway Management continued from cover 
which captured close to 75 percent of the intubations performed. 
A unique feature of this study was that it pooled findings from multiple EMS services from different practice and population settings. This may be the first attempt to obtain prehospital airway management data in this manner. 

PACE provided a cross­section sample of current prehospital airway man­agement practices. Among the most interesting find­ings: 
•
 The overall intubationsuccess rate was approxi­mately 87 percent; the success rates were approximately 93 percent for cardiac arrests and 77 percent for non-arrests. 

•
 Intubation success ratesdid not appear to vary by EMS service population setting (urban, suburban, 



rural). 
• 
The majority of intubations were accomplished using orotracheal methods. In non-arrest patients only, this trend was the similar, with naso­tracheal, sedation-facilitated, and rapid-sequence intubation each mak­ing up only about 10 percent of the cases. 

• 
There were 22 cases of tube dis­lodgement during patient care or transport. There was only one 


instance where an esophageal intubation was not recognized. 
•
 The availability of Combitubes wasrather limited – the majority of failed field intubations ended up being managed using bag-valve-mask ventilation. 

•
 Successful intubation did not appearto be associated with improved patient survival. 


Dr. Wang’s group also used data from PACE to develop a way to predict potential field intubation failure. Conceptually, this allows a paramedic to quickly predict cases where intubation may be difficult, and where drugs or an alternate airway might be considered. 
“We need to perform more work, but this is a good model of how we can simplify decision-making in the prehos­pital environment,” notes Dr. Wang. 
Phase II of the PACE study will take place in the near future, according to Dr. Wang. It is hoped that more services will participate and that more detailed information can be obtained about current intubation practices. The study will also expand to include the collection of data on pediatric and trauma cases. 
“Our vision is to use these data to help simplify the decisions that need to be made when performing airway interventions,” states Dr. Wang. “Making field airway management decisions more clear-cut will increase the overall intubation success rate while reducing the incidence of air­way management errors.”

Field Study: Lyme Disease 
Lyme Disease

It’s that time of year again. Time for fun in the sun as the summer comes into full swing. With summer comes more exposure to the outdoors and an increased threat of contraction of Lyme Disease. 
In 2000, there were 1,911 cases of confirmed Lyme Disease in Pennsylvania. While many of those took place in the woods to campers, hikers and outdoor workers, an increased number of cases have been reported in other wooded and grassy places, such as homes that are near wooded areas. The risk of exposure is highest in the woods and garden fringe areas of properties, but ticks can also be carried by animals into lawns and gardens. 
Because the threat of Lyme Disease is prevalent in this area, EMS personnel should be aware of the symptoms and treatments for this potentially deadly disease. 
What is Lyme Disease? 

caused by a bite from an infected deer tick. The tick, which normally feeds on mice, deer, birds and other mammals, carries the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria, which can be dangerous to humans. 
What are the symptoms of Lyme Disease? 
It takes about 24-48 hours for the tick to transmit the infection, so early detection and prompt removal of the tick is important. The disease usually manifests itself as a small, red rash called erythema migrans, often described as a “bulls-eye” shape. The rash begins within three days to a month after the bite and can expand to a large size. Sometimes numerous rashes occur, most often in the thigh, groin, trunk or armpits. The rash may be warm, but usually is not painful. Flu-like symptoms, such as chills and fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes and fatigue are common. Left untreated, the disease can lead to arthritis, heart- rhythm irregularities, and nervous-system abnormalities. 

What is the treatment for Lyme Disease? 
The disease is treated with antibiotics given by mouth, or intravenously for more severe cases. Individuals who are treated in the early stage of the disease usually respond very well. Those treated in the later stage usually recover but may experience recurring symptoms or permanent joint damage. 
What precautions can be taken to decrease the risk of being bitten by an infected tick? 
Pennsylvania Physician General Dr. Robert Muscalus recently issued the following precautions that can be taken: 
• 
Use insect repellent containing DEET in concentrations less than 40 percent on clothes and exposed skin, except the face. Follow the directions on the label to avoid skin irritation and other toxic effects. 

•
Avoid tick infested areas, such as high grass and weeds – especially in May, June and July. 


•
Wear light-colored clothing so ticks can be spotted easily. 

•
Wear a hat, long-sleeved shirt, and long pants for added protection. 

•
Tuck pant legs into socks or boots, and tuck shirts into pants. Tape the areas where pants and socks meet. 

•
Walk in the center of trails to avoid overhanging brush. 

• 
After being outdoors, remove clothing and wash at high temperatures. 

• 
Check the body for ticks. If a tick is found, remove it using fine-tipped tweezers, grasping the tick as close to the skin as possible and slowly pulling it straight out. Wash hands thoroughly after handling a tick. 


What precautions can be taken to control ticks? 
The best precaution for Lyme Disease is to reduce the likelihood of ticks in areas close to woods or gardens. Remove leaves and clear brush and tall grass around the house and edges of gardens. Apply chemicals that are toxic to ticks (acaricides) to gardens, lawns and edges of woodlands near homes. Reduce the likelihood of deer in the area by removing plants that attract deer and putting up fences and barriers to discourage deer from coming close to the home. 
For more information on Lyme Disease prevention and treatment, contact the Pennsylvania Department of Health at 1-877-PAHEALTH.

Volunteers Sought for 
Save-A-Life Saturday 


re you a cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) instructor? If so, your help is needed to train hundreds of people in CPR at the Allegheny County EMS Council’s Save-A-Life Saturday, pre­sented by UPMC Health System. This CPR training event is part of the American 
Heart Association’s Operation Heartbeat initiative. 
The event, now in its seventh year, will be held at a new location – the 
David L. Lawrence Convention Center in downtown Pittsburgh – on Saturday, August 17, from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Both AHA and ARC instructors are needed to teach CPR. Non-instructor volunteers also are needed to assist with registration, mannequin care, and basic preparation. There are several shifts available and all volunteers will receive free meals and refreshments, a t-shirt, and a CPR class if needed. 
Last year nearly 800 people were trained in adult CPR and infant-and-child CPR in a single day. Research shows that as more people are trained in CPR, the rate of death by cardiac arrest decreases. 
To volunteer, fill out the form below, call the Save-A-Life Saturday hotline at (412) 473-3371, email salsat@adelphia.com, or visit the Save-A-Life Saturday Web site at www.acemscouncil.org. 
In addition to volunteering, scholarship sponsors are also being sought for this event to under­write the cost for employees or those who cannot afford classes. Organizations can pay a fee of $100 to sponsor 20 participants to learn either adult or infant/child CPR. The cost to participants who are not sponsored is $5 per class plus an additional $5 for certification cards and written exams. AED classes will also be offered for $25.

ne of the largest crowds ever ven­
tured to Seven Springs Mountain Resort to be a part of the annual EMSI Update in March. Close to 1,500 people from across Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia and Maryland attended this year’s conference. Those in attendance enjoyed a wide range of activities including continuing education classes, exhibitor hall, a legislative luncheon, and fun social events. 
EMSI Update a Huge Success



During the course of the three-day event, a faculty of 72 professionals ran 74 courses for 648 registrants. The seminars that were the best-attended focused on terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, chemical warfare, and crime scene investigation. Also, 47 exhibitors, the second highest total ever, spread over two floors to show their wares and answer questions from interested participants. 

And, for the third year in a row, exhibitor space sold out prior to the conference. 
The following are some of the highlights of the 2002 EMS Update: 
Keynote speaker, Mark McGregor, of Ontario, Canada, shared with the audience his experience of suffering two cardiac arrests in which he was shocked back to life by EMS personnel using an AED (automated external defibrillator). His

Kennedy was honored for his years of service as Chief of the EMS in Pittsburgh as well as his volunteer activities and dedication to EMS and public safety (see related story on page 11). 
EMSI sponsored its second annual leg­islative luncheon. About 10 legislators attended and spoke with staff and EMSI Board members about problems in recruitment and retention of EMS providers, the reimbursement rates for ambulances, and reimbursement rates for Medicaid (see related story on page 3).

eriodically, the EMSI staff are asked questions that may be of interest to other EMS personnel. The following are three recently asked questions and their answers. Are Basic Life Support crews permitted on Advanced Life Support trucks? 
Basic Life Support crews can run on an Advanced Life Support truck as long they don’t give advanced life support care. 
If an EMS personnel is off duty and comes across an accident where there are injured people, is there a duty to act? 
No, EMS personnel are only required to treat a patient if they are on duty and dispatched to an emergency. Any other time, EMS personnel do not have a duty to act, but an opportunity to act. It is not a requirement to stop and pro­vide treatment. Instead, if EMS personnel stop while off duty, they are protect­ed under the Good Samaritan Act that covers people helping in good faith. 
Is there peer review protection for EMS participants in the Quality Assurance/Peer Review Activities? 
Peer review is protected from discovery as long as the body that conducts the peer review falls within the definition of a “review organization” and the type and purpose of the review meets the criteria for protection under the Act. The peer review organizations established by the Department of Health EMS regu­lations qualify as “review organizations” and should be protected. Records that are being reviewed are not protected. If the review is conducted for disciplinary purposes, it most likely would not be protected. However, certain portions of those investigation records may be protected under other laws and privileges.

Chief Robert Kennedy Named EMS Practitioner of the Year 

s is tradition, EMSI named its EMS Practitioner of the Year at the EMSI Update conference in March. And the winner is…Robert A. Kennedy, City of Pittsburgh EMS chief. Kennedy was named for his continuing contribution to the safety and well-being of Pittsburgh’s residents and visitors. 
A decorated Vietnam veteran, Kennedy began his EMS career in 1974 as a student in the Associate’s Degree program for paramedics at Community College of Allegheny County. His training included ambulance tours with the Freedom House Enterprises Ambulance Service. In 1975, he joined the inaugural group of paramedics in the City of Pittsburgh and was named chief in 1986. In addition to his role as chief of Pittsburgh EMS, Kennedy has served as the chairman of the Allegheny County EMS Council and treasurer of EMSI. He currently serves as a member of the Board of Directors for the Pennsylvania Emergency Health Services Council.

Remember the New Continuing Education Requirements 

asic Life Support (BLS) and Advanced Life Support (ALS) personnel are reminded that continuing education requirements for Pennsylvania prehospital personnel were revised in 2000. 
To recertify or to be eligible for medical command authorization using continuing education credits, practitioners must obtain 50 percent of the required edu­cation in medical/trauma direct patient care. The remaining 50 percent may be in the “other” category. 
Medical/trauma direct patient care is care and assessment of an individual who is believed to be sick, injured, wounded or otherwise incapacitated and helpless who is need of immediate medical attention. This includes all aspects of patient care, but not things such as response planning, legal aspects, communications, documentation, hazardous materials, EVOC, or other operational issues, which all fall under the “other” category. 
To qualify for continuing education credit in Pennsylvania, a program must relate to the scope of practice of the individual practitioner. The following are some guidelines for qualification: 
•
 BLS practitioners will not be awardedcredit for ALS programs that include skills beyond the scope of practice of the BLS practitioner. 

•
 First responders will not be awardedcredit for patient assisted medication programs because they are beyond the scope for the first responder. 


•
 No Pennsylvania prehospital practi-tioners will be awarded credit for CPR because it is an additional regulatory requirement. 

•
 A practitioner will be granted creditfor specific courses only one time in a certification cycle, even if the practi­tioner has taken the course each year. 


The requirements for prehospital prac­titioners are as follows: 
For recertification: 
First responder: 16 CEUs over three years; at least 8 must be medical/trauma. EMT: 24 CEUs over three years; at least 12 must be medical/trauma. 
For medical command authorization: 
EMT-P and PRHN: 18 CEUs in each cal­endar year; at least 9 must be medical/trauma. 
All requirements are affected after the first full certification period after October 14, 2000 for BLS (expiration dates of January 1, 2004 or later) and beginning in 2002 for ALS practitioners. 
For more information on the continuing education requirements, contact Linda Kovac, continuing education/training program specialist, at (412) 242-7322.

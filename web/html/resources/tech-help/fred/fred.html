    <td valign="top">FRED is the Facility Resource Emergency Database, an Internet-based system
that provides rapid, efficient, alert-driven reporting of resources available to mitigate mass casualty incidents or similar situations that produce
a surge of patients.&nbsp; It was originally developed by the Maryland Institute
for EMS Systems and has since been adopted by the Pennsylvania Department of
Health (PA DOH).</td>

<hr>
<p>Initial plans call for establishing Continuous FRED Monitoring Sites at all
of the commonwealth's receiving hospitals, Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs / 911 centers),
Emergency Management Agencies, and emergency information centers such as Poison
Centers.&nbsp; FRED can also be
accessed from any compliant Internet-connected web browser.</p>
<p>FRED's feature set is expected to grow as needed to fill its niche.&nbsp;
Because FRED is implemented as a web site, users will gain the benefit of any
new features as they are released, without having to perform any special
installations or upgrades.</p>

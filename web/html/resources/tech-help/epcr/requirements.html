<title>EMSI - ePCRs - Semantic requirements and approval process</title>
<h1>Technical help for prospective ePCR developers</h1>

<h2>Semantic requirements and approval process</h2>

<p>The following is adapted from letters issued by PA DOH EMSO to
prospective ePCR developers:</p>

<blockquote>
<small>
<p>The vendor must agree, in writing, to make changes to the software program at
no cost to the customer if the change is a minor one requested by the EMS
Office. A minor change is one that does not add or decrease a field. For
example, a change of the year in the date field is a minor change. The vendor
must agree, in writing, to provide to the EMS Office and to all licensed users
30-days advance notice before selling the vendor’s license program source code
and company, or going out of business. If circumstances prevent a vendor from
meeting the 30-day notice requirement, the vendor will provide input
specifications and the source code for the software program to the EMS Office at
no cost.</p>
<p>After the output specifications and the patient care information are obtained
from the EMS Office, the requirements that a PCR data collection software
program must meet are:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>It must have all the data elements identified in the column titled “Required
    Data Elements” on the EMS Patient Care Report Data and Information chart
    included in this notice.</p></li>
  <li><p>It must have symbols for years that are consistent with ASCII codes
    assigned by the aggregating data program.</p></li>
  <li><p>It must be able to collect and print narrative.</p></li>
  <li><p>It must be able to generate an ASCII flat file (undelimited).</p></li>
  <li><p>It must allow for the user or administrator to make corrections when data
    elements are omitted or a PCR is otherwise rejected showing that the PCR has
    been edited, and submit the revised PCR to the regional EMS council.</p></li>
  <li><p>It must assign a specific lithocode to each PCR and prevent duplication of
    lithocode assignments.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The prospective vendor must coordinate with a regional EMS council that is
willing to conduct a Beta test of the software program using 100 pre-prepared
PCRs provided by the EMS Office. The regional EMS council will run the raw data
files and generate reports from the statewide PCR data system for
validation.</p>
<p>The Beta test will include:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Two ambulance services each entering the data from 50 of the 100
    pre-prepared PCRs provided by the department.</p></li>
  <li><p>Printing of the 100 PCRs.</p></li>
  <li><p>Printing a list of the data elements collected.</p></li>
  <li><p>Printing reports that identify unit utilization for:</p>
</small>
    <ol type="a">
      <li><small>Response
    outcome, hour/day of week</li>
      </small>
      <li><small>Fractile time</li>
      </small>
      <li><small>Municipal response for
    each of the two beta sites.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><p>Printing the following reports:</p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Incident location/type report with number of calls and percentage
        of calls</li>
      <li>Trauma summary</li>
      <li>Revised trauma scores</li>
      <li>Glasgow coma scale</li>
      <li>Medical summary</li>
      <li>EKG</li>
      <li>Treatment summary</li>
      <li>Admission summary</li>
      <li>BLS and ALS skills report for each practitioner.</li>
      <li>BLS and ALS EMT skills report for each beta test site.</li>
      <li>Demographics summary (age, gender, total)</li>
      <li>Vital signs summary (ranges, systolic, diastolic, pulse,
        respiration)</li>
      <li>Attendant Activity</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><p>Printing output files of data elements to include:</p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Field number</li>
      <li>Field name</li>
      <li>Number of fields for each field name</li>
      <li>Type of field (i.e. numeric, blanks stored as “0”, mm/dd/yyyy,
        character Boolean, and acceptable field values)</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The regional EMS council that coordinates the Beta test will submit a letter
to the EMS Office recommending approval or disapproval. It will validate that
all of the aforementioned criteria have been met before recommending approval.
The EMS Office will notify the vendor as to whether the data collection software
program satisfies the requirements for electronic PCR reporting or, if the EMS
Office determines there are inadequacies, it will identify the corrections that
need to be made. Program must have ability to collect and print a narrative.</p>
<p>Send all Beta test artifacts to the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Office
of the Department of Health, P. O. Box, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17108, to be
evaluated by the EMS Office to ensure all requirements are met.</p>
<p>The software should have safeguards to limit omissions or entry of data that
does not meet the requirements of the business rules that are part of the EMS
Office data collection instruction manual</p>
<p>The EMS Office must approve any additional items added to data collection
fields that are written out as “other”. For example additional suspected
illnesses that are mapped to “other”.</p>
<p>Performance Standards:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li><p>The program vendor will not duplicate lithocode numbers. The vendor
    will not be responsible for a duplication that was caused by user error (a
    user restoring a backup causing re-entry of lithocode numbers).</p></li>
  <li><p>A program vendor will not exceed 1 hour in answering support calls for
    a single service during normal business hours Monday through Friday between
    9:00 AM and 4:00 PM in their own time zone within 1 hour more than 2 times
    in the period of a year and more than 40 times for all services in the
    period of a year. Support calls outside of normal business hours should be
    returned on the next business day.</p></li>
  <li><p>The program vendor must ensure that the program shall not exceed the
    following standards for non-compliant reports:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td width="25%">&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="25%" align="center">First year</td>
    <td width="25%" align="center">Second Year</td>
    <td width="25%" align="center">Third and Beyond</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="25%">Critical Errors/Omissions</td>
    <td width="25%" align="center">7%</td>
    <td width="25%" align="center">5%</td>
    <td width="25%" align="center">1%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="25%">Total Errors/Omissions (Critical + Business Logic)</td>
    <td width="25%" align="center">15%</td>
    <td width="25%" align="center">10%</td>
    <td width="25%" align="center">3%</td>
  </tr>
</table>
    <br>
</li>
  <li><p>In the event that a regional EMS council suspects that the
    vendor is exceeding the minimum non-compliance standards, that council will
    contact another regional EMS council with services utilizing that program.
    Both regions will record the non-compliance results from that program for
    one month and submit those findings to the EMS Office or its designee for
    review.&nbsp; If another council is not available or if that vendor is not
    in another region, two months of data will be reviewed.</p></li>
  <li><p>If it is determined that the software has a “bug” that is causing a
    critical error or omission, that vendor will make any necessary corrections
    to the program, test that field with a regional council, and make that
    program update available to all customers, at no cost, within 25 business
    days of notification. The vendor will retroactively fix any regional data
    affected by the “bug” within 50 business days of notification.</p></li>
  <li><p>If it is determined that the software has a “bug” that is causing a
    business logic error or omission, that vendor will make any necessary
    corrections to the program, test that field with a regional council, and
    make that program update available to all customers, at not cost, within 50
    business days of notification. The vendor will retroactively fix any
    regional data affected by the “bug” within 100 business days of
    notification.</p></li>
  <li><p>The program vendor must agree to notify the EMS Office and all licensed
    users at least thirty days prior to selling your license or going out of
    business. If you fail to provide the thirty days notification, you will
    provide the input specifications for your program to the EMS Office at no
    cost.</p></li>
  <li><p>The program vendor must agree to the ACSII symbol sequences stated in
    the letter of February 15, 2002.</p></li>
  <li><p>Lithocodes 16130000-16130100 will be used for the purpose of conducting
    this beta test.&nbsp;</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once the EMS Office has received all the documentation, a determination will
be made as to whether your software meets Pennsylvania's requirements.</p>

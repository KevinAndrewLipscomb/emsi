Introduction

This document has been prepared by the Emergency Medical Services Office (EMSO) of the Department of Health (Department) to assist applicants that are applying for an initial ambulance service license or a renewal of an ambulance service license. The information applies to both ground and air ambulance (rotorcraft) service licenses except where otherwise noted. The manual repeats some statutory and regulatory provisions. It also explains some of those provisions. However, the manual is not itself a regulation. It is not a document by which standards may be set. Consequently, it does not have the force or effect of law. Furthermore, although the EMSO may revise this manual from time to time to keep it up to date, statutory, regulatory or policy changes may occur following the distribution of this manual and later revisions. Therefore, the applicant is encouraged to review a current copy of the Emergency Medical Services Act and the Department’s regulations and to confer with the appropriate regional emergency medical services (EMS) council to secure additional assistance. The applicant should log onto the Department’s website to secure the most up to date copy of this manual. 

Application 
1.	
Obtaining an application. An application for a license or renewal of a license as an ambulance service may be obtained from any regional EMS council. A list of those councils, their addresses and telephone numbers is set forth in Attachment A. The Department recommends that an applicant secure the application from the regional EMS council      assigned responsibility for the EMS region in which the applicant maintains or intends to maintain its administrative headquarters. If the applicant’s administrative headquarters is located outside the Commonwealth, it should secure the application from the regional EMS      council responsible for the EMS region in which it will conduct most of its operations in the Commonwealth. If the applicant will be maintaining an administrative office in more than      one EMS region, it is required to choose one of those offices as its administrative headquarters. The application is the same for both an initial license and the renewal of a license. Attachment B contains a copy of the application and the instructions for completing it. 

2.	
Completing an application. An applicant must complete the application correctly and accurately in its entirety. To ensure this occurs, the applicant needs to carefully review and follow the instructions to the application in Attachment B. The applicant should contact the      appropriate regional EMS council for assistance if the applicant believes that the instructions do not address a matter pertinent to the applicant and relevant to the application or if the      applicant is confused about any matter in the application or instructions. An application that is incomplete or inaccurate will be returned to the applicant with directions to remedy the problem before resubmitting it. 

3.	
 Filing an application. An applicant must return the application to the regional EMS council responsible for the region in which the applicant maintains or intends to maintain its administrative headquarters. If the applicant will be placing and operating ambulances in 

       more than one EMS region, the applicant is required to file the original application with the regional EMS council assigned responsibility for the EMS region in which the applicant maintains or intends to maintain its administrative headquarters. The applicant must also        submit a copy of the application to the regional EMS council responsible for each other EMS region in which the applicant intends to place and operate ambulances. An ambulance        service “places and operates ambulances in an EMS region” when it places ambulances in that EMS region as a starting point for daily transport or emergency response operations and operates those ambulances from that EMS region. Regardless of where an ambulance picks        up or transports patients, the applicant is not required to file a copy of its license application with the regional EMS council responsible for that area unless the applicant intends to both place an ambulance in that EMS region and operate the ambulance from that EMS region. 

4.	
 Attachments to application. As part of the application, the applicant must provide various documents, such as a staffing plan and a personnel roster. Forms that must be completed are        included in Attachment B as appendices to the license application. The applicant may use additional sheets if the forms in the appendices to the license application do not afford adequate space for the applicant to provide all of the information requested. 

5.	
 Policy statements and other docume ntation. The applicant is required to prepare and maintain various written policies and other documentation. These are listed in Appendix C of the license application. An applicant for renewal of an ambulance service license will need to have all of the policies and other documentation listed. An applicant for its initial license as an ambulance service must have the policies listed and some of the other       documentation listed, but not the documented information that could be provided only by an applicant that is already operating as an ambulance service. The policies and other required documentation must be presented to the inspector at the time of the license inspection. 

6.	
 Review of application. The regional EMS council assigned responsibility for the EMS region in which the applicant maintains or intends to maintain it’s administrative headquarters will review the application. If the applicant will be maintaining and operating        ambulances in more than one EMS region, the regional EMS council responsible for each of these regions will review the application for the information that is applicable to the region        for which it is responsible. If the application is incomplete or inaccurate, the application will be returned to the applicant by the regional EMS council that is responsible for the EMS region for which the information in the application is incomplete or inaccurate, with an        explanation of the problems presented by the application. The applicant must make the necessary corrections and resubmit the original application to the regional EMS council        where the applicant maintains or intends to maintain its administrative headquarters. The applicant must submit a copy of the corrected application to each of the other regional EMS councils with which the applicant filed a copy of the original application. When the regional        EMS council that identified the problem is satisfied that the application is complete and accurate, it will inform the applicant and the regional EMS council responsible for the EMS region where the applicant maintains or intends to maintain its administrative headquarters. 


Inspection 
1. 	
Scheduling the inspection. When the regional EMS council has determined that the application is complete and accurate, it will contact the applicant and schedule a time and date for the license inspection. 

2. 	
Conducting the inspection. The regional EMS council will conduct an inspection of the applicant’s records to ensure that the applicant has developed and maintains the applicable        documents enumerated in Appendix C of the application. In addition, it will inspect each ambulance listed in the application to ensure that it is equipped and supplied for the level of license for which the applicant is applying. All of the applicant’s ambulances will be        inspected at the same time, but exceptions are permitted as necessary to not jeopardize patient care or operation of the ambulance service. Attachment C is a complete listing of        both the vehicle requirements and the required equipment and supplies. If the applicant will be placing and operating ambulances in more than one EMS region, the regional EMS council responsible for each of those regions will inspect the ambulances the applicant        intends to place and operate in the EMS region for which the regional EMS council is responsible. 

3. 	
Inspection results. Upon completion of the license inspection the inspector shall provide the applicant with a copy of the inspection report completed by the inspector. The absence of        marked deficiencies on the inspection report is not a guarantee that the applicant will be licensed. The Department makes the final decision regarding whether the applicant meets the requirements for a license, also, not all licensure requirements are evaluated during the license inspection. Inspection results will be collected and processed by the regional EMS        council responsible for the EMS region where the applicant maintains or intends to maintain its administrative headquarters. If there are multiple EMS regions involved, each of the other regional EMS councils will forward its inspection report to the regional EMS responsible for        the EMS region where the applicant maintains its administrative headquarters. This regional EMS council will review the inspection reports and forward them along with its assessment        of the applicant’s qualifications for a license to the EMSO. The EMSO will review the reports and the recommendation and make a final determination on whether the applicant 


has met all of the requirements for a license. 


Licensure 
1.	
Levels of licenses. The EMSO issues a BLS ambulance service license or an ALS ambulance service license, as applicable, to an applicant for a ground ambulance service license. It issues an air ambulance service license to an applicant that applies to use a rotorcraft as an air       ambulance. 

2.	
Types of licenses. 

a. 	
License-Issued when all of the requirements for licensure have been met.  The license will be valid for 3 years. 

b. 
Provisional license-Issued when an applicant or an existing ambulance service fails to meet all of the licensure requirements, and the EMSO deems it to be in the public interest to issue the provisional license. A provisional license will be issued for a                  maximum of 6 of months and may be renewed one time at the EMSO’s discretion. 




The renewal shall be for a maximum of 6 months, except the EMSO may issue a renewal for a maximum of 12 months if the applicant is a volunteer BLS ambulance service.
 c. 	Temporary license-Issued when an applicant for an ALS service license or an                  existing ALS ambulance service cannot provide service 24 hours a day 7 days                  a week and the Department deems it is in the public interest to issue a temporary license. A temporary license is valid for 1 year and may be renewed once. 
3.	Licensure materials. Once the EMSO has made its decision to issue a license to the applicant, it will prepare a license and include on the license certificate the following: the name of the ambulance service, its license number, the address of the administrative       headquarters, the dates of issuance and expiration, the levels of service the applicant is authorized to provide, the name of the regional EMS council through which license application was processed, and the locations out of which the ambulance service will be      placing and operating ambulances. In addition, two decals will be prepared for each       ambulance. These decals will include a seven-digit identification number. The first 5 digits will be the affiliate number assigned to the applicant by the regional EMS council assigned       responsibility for the EMS region where the applicant maintains or intends to maintain its administrative headquarters. The last 2 digits will be the vehicle number of the ambulance       designated by the applicant. The decals will also have a date strip identifying the issuance and expiration dates of the license. The license and the decals will be sent by the EMSO to the regional EMS council that has responsibility for the EMS region in which the applicant       maintains its administrative headquarters. The decals must be placed on the outside on each side of the ambulance. A copy of the license will be provided by the EMSO to the regional EMS councils responsible for other EMS regions where the service will maintain       and operate ambulances. The regional EMS council responsible for the EMS region in which the applicant maintains its administrative headquarters will distribute all of the original materials to the ambulance service. 

Ambulance Replacement

1.	
Types of replacement. After an ambulance service is licensed it may permanently add additional ambulances to its operation, permanently replace ambulances, or temporarily replace ambulances that are temporarily removed from service. 

2.	
Forms. An ambulance service is required to file a Modification of Ambulance Fleet Form before permanently adding or replacing an ambulance, and a Temporary Change of Vehicle       Form within 24 hours after temporarily replacing an ambulance. The ambulance service may use the forms in Attachment D or secure the appropriate form from a regional EMS council or off of the Department’s website www.health.state.pa.us. The ambulance service should contact the regional EMS council responsible for the EMS region in which it is adding or replacing an ambulance if it is unsure about which form to use. 

3.	
Permanent ambulance addition or replacement. If the ambulance service intends to permanently add or replace an ambulance, it must file a Modification of Ambulance Fleet/Temporary Change of Vehicle Form with the regional EMS council responsible for the       EMS region where the ambulance service intends to place and operate the amb ulance. The ambulance service is not permitted to use the permanent addition or replacement ambulance until the ambulance has been inspected and it is authorized to operate by the EMSO. To       expedite matters, the ambulance service may call the appropriate regional EMS council in advance of filing the form to arrange for an inspection of the ambulance. The regional EMS council will conduct the inspection of the ambulance and if the ambulance meets all of the       requirements, the regional EMS council will provide the ambulance service with a letter that authorizes use of the ambulance. The regional EMS council will forward the inspection       results to the EMSO. The EMSO will review the results and, if all requirements are satisfied, will prepare and forward decals to the regional EMS council. The regional EMS council will provide the decals to the ambulance service, which shall promptly affix the decals to the       ambulance. It should take no more than 10 days from the date the form is filed with the regional EMS council to the date the decals are delivered to the ambulance service. 

4.	
Temporary ambulance replacement. An ambulance service may replace an ambulance with a temporary replacement ambulance without giving prior notice to the regional EMS council responsible for the EMS region where the temporary replacement ambulance will be placed and operated. However, it must submit a Modification of Ambulance Fleet/Temporary Change of Vehicle Form to that regional EMS council no later than 24 hours after commencing operation of the replacement ambulance. It may submit the form by any means       that ensures that the regional EMS council receives the form within 24 hours after the ambulance service begins using the temporary replacement ambulance. The duty to file the       form applies even if the ambulance service does not use the replacement after the 24-hour       period. After receiving the form, the regional EMS council will prepare and issue a temporary certificate to the ambulance service authorizing it to use the temporary ambulance for 7 days. This certificate must be displayed in a prominent place in the ambulance. If the       ambulance service requires the use of the ambulance for an additional period of time past the initial 7 day period, it is required to notify the regional EMS council. The regional EMS       council may extend the time period by letter. The regional EMS council may inspect the 



 temporary replacement ambulance at any time. If the temporary replacement ambulance does not satisfy applicable requirements the EMSO may suspend it from operation or direct the      ambulance service to correct the deficiencies. After the ambulance service receives a temporary certificate authorizing its use of a temporary replacement ambulance it shall display the certificate in a conspicuous place in that ambulance and shall keep in that      ambulance a copy of any letter from the regional EMS council extending the expiration date of the temporary certificate. No decals will be issued for the temporary ambulance. 

License Amendment 
1. 	
Reasons for an amendment. An ambulance service must seek an amendment of its license for any of the following reasons: 1) to substantially alter the location and operation of its ambulances within an EMS region, 2) to place and operate an ambulance in an EMS region       not identified in its most recent license application, 3) to change its license from a BLS to an ALS ambulance service or vice versa, or 4) to make a change in its operation that would       render inaccurate any information in its license certificate. An ambulance service should contact the regional EMS council responsible for the EMS region in which it maintains its administrative headquarters if it intends to make a change in its operations and is uncertain       whether it needs to apply for and secure an amendment of its license before doing so. The transfer of the license of an ambulance service to a different owner cannot be achieved through a license amendment. The new owner needs to apply for and secure its own license       before commencing operations. 

2. 	
Amendment procedures. An ambulance service is to file an application for amendment with the regional EMS council responsible for the EMS region in which the ambulance       service has its administrative headquarters. Some types of application for amendment, such as applications to change the level of licensure from BLS to ALS, or to place and operate ambulances in an additional EMS region, will require an inspection before the application       can be acted upon.  Other types of applications for amendment, such as an application to show a fictitious name change, do not require an inspection before a decision can be made on       the application. Chart #1 is a flow chart showing how an application for amendment is processed when the applicant seeks to change its level of service from BLS to ALS. Chart #2 is a flow chart showing how an application for amendment is processed when the applicant       seeks to place and operate ambulances in an EMS region where it had not previously placed and operated ambulances. An ambulance service that is planning to locate and maintain ambulances in a region not identified in its most recent application will be required to submit       the amended application to the regional EMS council responsible for the region in which the ambulance service plans to place and operate ambulances. The ambulance service must also       submit a copy of its application to the regional EMS council responsible for the region where it maintains its administrative headquarters. The regional EMS council responsible for the EMS region in which the ambulance service plans to begin placing and operating ambulances       will conduct an inspection of the ambulances and required supplies and equipment. It will forward the inspection results along with a recommendation to the EMSO. 

3. 	
Change to license. After the EMSO receives the inspection results, if applicable, and is       satisfied that the ambulance service has met the licensure requirements relative to the amendment, it will prepare an amended license for the ambulance service. If required, decals       for a new ambulance will be prepared. The amended license and any decals will be sent to the regional EMS council with which the original copy of the amended application was filed. The EMSO will provide a copy of the amended license to the regional EMS councils       responsible for the EMS regions in which the ambulance service already places and operates ambulances.

If the applicant intends to place and operate ambulances out of more than one fixed location, the applicant must provide information first for the station it chooses as its primary base of operation. 

18. 
System Status Management-- An applicant must complete this item if it does not intend to place and operate ambulances out of a fixed location.  If the applicant intends to place and operate ambulances out of more than one service area, the applicant will need to provide the requested information for each service area.  Information regarding administrative offices is to be provided for each administrative office that will be used by the applicant in operating the ambulance service. Because the Department must determine whether the applicant meets licensure criteria such as operating ambulances that are maintained to safely and efficiently render the services offered, this item needs to be completed in great detail. If the applicant is confused regarding how to complete this item, the applicant should contact the appropriate regional EMS council for assistance. 

19. 
Emergency Service Areas-- An emergency service area is the area an applicant will be able to routinely reach to respond to emergencies within the time identified as a goal in the regional EMS development plan (usually 10 minutes in urban and 20 minutes in rural areas). NOTE:  This may be different than a “service area”.  A service area is the geographic area in which the applicant routinely provides services. This item is to be completed by all applicants; even those that intend to limit their services to interfacility or nonemergency transports.  The applicant must list the name of the municipalities, along with their five-digit MCD numbers, that the applicant will be able to generally reach by ambulance within the time frames recommended by the regional EMS development plan for responding to emergencies.  The MCD number may be secured from the regional EMS council. The applicant may use additional sheets if the number of municipalities exceeds the number that can be listed in the application form.  Also, the applicant shall use additional sheets if the applicant will maintain and operate ambulances out of more than one fixed location.  If the applicant intends to use a form of system status management to conduct its operations, the applicant must contact the regional EMS council for each region in which it will place and operate ambulances for direction on how to complete this item. The regional EMS council will review the applicant’s system status management plan to help it identify the area or areas it will be most likely to reach routinely within the time identified as a goal in the regional EMS development plan.  If the applicant is applying to operate an air ambulance service, it must provide a list of the area(s) (usually counties) that it will be serving instead of providing a list of the municipalities and the MCD #. If the applicant intends to engage primarily in nonemergency and interfacility transports, it must also complete item #20 on the application. 


Ambulance Service License Instructions 4 March 19, 2001 
20. 
Nonemergency and InterfacilityTransports--If the applicant plans to engage primarily in the interfacility or nonemergency transport of patients, it must provide a description of its operations. Note that by providing this information in the application the applicant, after being licensed, is not precluded from responding to emergency calls.  This information is solicited to assist emergency dispatch planning.  Moreover, if the applicant is dispatched to an emergency, it must respond to the emergency unless its resources are otherwise committed. The applicant may use additional sheets to describe its operation if the applicant will place and operate ambulances out of more than one location. If the applicant is confused regarding how to complete this item, the applicant should contact the appropriate regional EMS council for assistance. 

21. 
Ground Vehicles and Aircraft--Under Part A, the applicant shall specify the types and number of ambulances that it intends to use. Under Parts B and C, the applicant shall provide the information identified for each ground vehicle and aircraft it intends to use as an ambulance. Under Part B, in the first column the applicant shall identify the year of ambulance by using the ground ambulance designations specified in part A. If the applicant will place and operate ambulances out of more than one fixed location (or area if the applicant will be using a form of system status management), the applicant shall provide the location of each ambulance. If the applicant rotates a vehicle between or among locations as part of its maintenance procedures, it does not have to notify the appropriate regional EMS council. If the rotation will have an impact that will alter its emergency response it must describe this in the space for system status management. If the applicant intends to operate ambulances through a form of system status management and is confused regarding how to complete this item, the applicant should contact the appropriate regional EMS council for assistance. 

22. 
Medical Direction--If the applicant is applying for a license as an ALS ambulance service the applicant shall provide information on the physician who will be serving as the ALS service medical director.  If the applicant is applying for a BLS ambulance service license and intends to use an AED or pulse oximetry, the applicant shall provide information on the physician who will be serving as the AED and pulse oximetry medical director for the BLS ambulance service.  For the latter, the applicant shall complete only those lines preceded by an asterisk.  If the applicant for a BLS ambulance service license wants to be able to carry ALS equipment and drugs in addition to those generally prescribed for use by a BLS ambulance service, it will need to secure additional direction from the appropriate regional EMS council regarding how to supplement its application.  In that event the applicant will need to have a medical director who is directly responsible for the security accountability, administration and maintenance of the equipment and drugs, and the arrangement will need to be approved by the Department as being in the public interest. 

23. 
Communication Capabilities—The applicant shall indicate the source from which it receives emergency medical dispatch. The applicant shall also place a check in each appropriate box to indicate the primary means that it utilizes for communicating with its dispatch center, the medical command facility and for communicating in the event of a disaster or multiple casualty incidents. The applicant shall also indicate how it receives 


Ambulance Service License Instructions 5 March 19, 2001 
emergency calls. This information is required for each service area the applicant intends to serve. 
24. 
Policy Statements and Other Documents--Appendix C identifies the policies and other documentation an ambulance service is required to prepare and maintain. An applicant for an initial ambulance service license will need to prepare and maintain all of the listed policies and some of the other documents listed. An applicant for renewal of an ambulance service license will need to have all of the documents listed. There is nothing for the applicant to complete under this item. The documents and policies need to be available when the license inspection is conducted. 

25. 
Management Team--The applicant shall provide the requested information for each person on the applicant’s management team. Members of the management team are those persons who will be responsible for directing the operation of the ambulance service. If the applicant is confused regarding how to complete this item, the applicant should contact the appropriate regional EMS council for assistance. 

26. 
Other Owners--If applicable, the applicant shall provide the requested information for persons that have an ownership interest in the applicant but do not serve on the applicant’s management team.  If a person with an ownership interest is not an individual (for example, a corporation), the applicant shall identify that person and provide the requested information for each individual that has an ownership interest in that person. 

27. 
Conviction and Disciplinary Information for Member of Management Team--


This information is requested to help the Department determine whether the applicant is staffed by responsible persons.  Being staffed by responsible persons is one of the statutory criteria for licensure.  Disclosure of a past conviction or disciplinary sanction does not result in the automatic rejection of the application. The Department will consider factors such as conduct resulting in the conviction or discipline, the number of such episodes, the time that has elapsed since the conviction or discipline, and conduct that demonstrates rehabilitation, to determine whether responsible persons staff the applicant at the time the application is acted upon. The intentional failure to make the required disclosure in the application is a serious statutory violation and could lead to discipline, including revocation of the license. If the applicant answers “yes,” it must identify the relevant person or persons. To help the EMSO expedite its review, the applicant must secure and enclose the documents that charged the criminal or disciplinary misconduct and the documents that disposed of those charges as well as any rehabilitation information the applicant wants the Department to consider. The failure to provide these documents may prolong the time the EMSO needs to make a decision on the application. The applicant will not be held responsible for false information if the applicant has requested this information from all appropriate persons and one or more of those persons has provided false information. 
28. Conviction and Disciplinary Information Relating to Other Ambulance Service--This information is requested to help the Department determine whether responsible persons staff the applicant, which is one of the statutory criteria for licensure. 
Ambulance Service License Instructions 6 March 19, 2001 
The Department will consider past negative history in operating an ambulance service of a member of the applicant’s management team to determine whether responsible persons staff the applicant. This disclosure will not result in the automatic rejection of the application. Factors such as those listed in paragraph 27 will be considered. The intentional failure to make the required disclosure in the application is a serious statutory violation and could lead to discipline, including revocation of the license. If the applicant answered “yes,” it must identify the relevant person or persons. To help the EMSO expedite its review, the applicant must secure and enclose the documents that charged criminal or disciplinary misconduct and the documents that disposed of those charges as well as any rehabilitation information the applicant wants the Department to consider. The failure to provide these documents may prolong the time the EMSO needs to make a decision on the application. The applicant will not be held responsible for false information if the applicant has requested this information from all appropriate persons and one or more of those persons has provided false information. 
29. Management Service Contracts--The applicant must provide the name of any organization that it intends to use to provide any type of management services for the applicant. The applicant must also provide the name of any ambulance service for which it will provide any type of management services. Management services include services such as billing, bookkeeping and other administrative functions. An ambulance service may not assign substantive decisionmaking functions to another entity. The information must clearly state whether the applicant is providing or receiving management services. 
The signature at the end of the application form verifies that the application is true and correct.  This verification is required by regulation.  It is also a regulatory requirement that only the applicant’s principal official may sign for the applicant.

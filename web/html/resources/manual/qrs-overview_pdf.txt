Introduction This document has been prepared by the Emergency Medical Services Office (EMSO) of the Department of Health (Department) to assist applicants that are applying for initial quick response service (QRS) recognition or renewal of QRS recognition. A QRS is defined by regulation as “an entity recognized by the Department to respond to an emergency and to provide EMS to patients pending the arrival of the prehospital personnel of an ambulance service”. This manual repeats some statutory and regulatory provisions. It also explains some of those provisions. However, the manual is not itself a regulation.  It is not a document by which standards may be set. Consequently, it does not have the force or effect of law. Furthermore, although the EMSO may revise this manual from time to time to keep it up to date, statutory, regulatory or policy changes may occur following the distribution of this manual and later revisions. Therefore, the applicant is encouraged to review a current copy of the Emergency Medical Services Act and the Department’s regulations and to confer with the appropriate regional emergency medical services (EMS) council to secure additional assistance. The applicant should log onto the Department’s website at www.health.state.pa.us to secure the most up-to-date copy of this manual. 

Application 
1. 	
Obtaining an application. An application for initial or renewal of QRS recognition may be obtained from any regional EMS council. A list of those councils, their addresses and telephone numbers are in Attachment A. The application is the same for both initial recognition and the renewal of an existing recognition. Attachment B contains a copy of the application and the instructions for completing it. 

2. 	
Completing the application. An applicant must complete the application correctly and accurately in its entirety. To ensure this occurs, the applicant must carefully review and follow the instructions to the application found in Appendix 2 of Attachment B. The       applicant should contact the appropriate regional EMS council for assistance if the applicant believes that the instructions do not address a matter pertinent to the applicant and relevant to       the application or if the applicant is confused about any matter in the application instructions. An application that is incomplete or inaccurate will be returned to the applicant with directions to remedy the problem before resubmitting it. 

3. 	
Filing an application. An applicant must return the application to the regional EMS council responsible for the region in which the applicant will maintain its physical location. 

4. 	
Appendices to application. A QRS must respond with at least one individual who possesses      the minimum qualifications of a prehospital practitioner. An applicant is required to prepare a roster of persons who have committed to serve as QRS members, along with their qualifications. Appendix 1 of Attachment B contains a sample personnel roster form that can      be used, or the applicant may use its own form provided the requested information is included. If the form in the appendix does not afford adequate space, the applicant may use additional sheets. 

5.
 Patient Data and Information. The applicant must satisfy the requirements of §§1001.41 and 1001.42 of the EMS regulations relating to data and information requirements and the dissemination of this information. 

6.
 Policy Statements. While an applicant is not required to have specific policies in place, it is recommended that each QRS develop and maintain specific policies addressing, at a minimum, infection control, management of personnel safety, substance abuse in the     workplace, completion of EMS patient care reports, dissemination and protection of patient information, use of lights and warning devices, weapons and explosives and participation in statewide and regional quality improvement programs. 

7. 	
Review of application. The regional EMS council assigned responsibility for the EMS region in which the applicant will operate will review the application. If the application is incomplete or inaccurate, the regional EMS council will return the application to the applicant      with an explanation of the problems presented by the application.  The applicant must make the necessary corrections and resubmit the application to the regional EMS council. 



Inspection 
1. 	
Scheduling the inspection. When the regional EMS council has determined that      the application is complete and accurate; it will contact the applicant and schedule a time and date for the inspection. 

2. 	
Conducting the inspection. The regional EMS council will inspect all of the required      supplies to ensure that they are available and that the equipment is in working order. Attachment C is a complete listing of the required equipment and supplies. While a vehicle is not required for a QRS, if the applicant chooses to operate designated vehicles, the inspector      will inspect any vehicle to confirm that it is being operated in accordance with all the current motor vehicle requirements of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.

 3.
 Inspection results. Upon completion of the recognition inspection, the inspector shall provide the applicant with a copy of the inspection report completed by the inspector. The absence of marked deficiencies on the inspection report is not a guarantee that the applicant meets the requirements for recognition. The Department makes the final decision regarding whether the applicant meets the requirements for recognition. Inspection reports will be reviewed by the regional EMS council, which will forward them along with its assessment of      the applicant’s qualifications for recognition to the EMS Office.  The EMS Office will review the reports and the recommendation and make a final determination on whether the applicant has met all of the requirements for recognition. 



Recognition 
1. 	Recognition materials. Once the EMS Office has made its decision to issue a recognition to the applicant, it will prepare a certificate of recognition and include on the certificate the     following: the name of the QRS, the dates of issuance and expiration, and the recognition  number and the name of the regional EMS council through which the recognition application was processed. If the applicant has dedicated vehicles that will be used, two decals will be      issued for each of its vehicles.  Even if the applicant may not be operating any vehicle, if it chooses, the EMS Office will prepare two decals that can be placed in the applicant’s headquarters. These decals will have a date strip identifying the issuance and expiration year of the recognition. The EMS Office will send the recognition certificate and the decals to the regional EMS council through which the applicant submitted its application. A copy of      the EMS Office will provide the recognition certificate to the regional EMS council. The regional EMS council will distribute all of the original materials to the applicant.

FORWARD

The Pennsylvania Voluntary Rescue Service Recognition (VRSR) Program was prepared by the Rescue Task Force of the Pennsylvania Emergency Health Services Council (PEHSC) under contract with the Pennsylvania Department of Health, Emergency Medical Services Office (EMS Office). 
The first phase of this program is the implementation of the vehicle rescue section. The purpose of this program is to recognize those emergency services that can safely and efficiently perform rescue operations. In the future we anticipate adding the following disciplines: * 
1. 
Agriculture Rescue 

2. 
Collapse Rescue 

3. 
Confined Space Rescue 

4. 
Industrial Rescue 

5. 
Rope Rescue 

6. 
Transportation Rescue (Plane, Train and Automobile) 

7. 
Trench/Cave-in Rescue 

8. 
Water and Ice Rescue 

9. 
Wilderness Search and Rescue 


It is also the intent of this document that an emergency service may be recognized in any one or a combination of any or all disciplines listed. This document not only takes into account the equipment or hardware requirements, but includes minimum manpower and training requirements. 
*At this time the document contains only the vehicle rescue component.

PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTARY RESCUE SERVICE
RECOGNITION PROGRAM

I.	RESCUE LEVELS 
A.	Each Rescue discipline is based on a tiered rescue response to a specific operation. This response is based on three levels: 
1.	
Advanced Level 

2.	
Operations Level. 

3.	
First Response Level 


a.	Advanced 
Identifies basic tools, equipment (hand and basic power tools), manpower and training requirements that personnel trained to advanced levels can use to undertake basic through complex rescue operations. This equipment may be carried on a heavy rescue squad or other specialized rescue unit. 
b.	Operations 
Identifies basic tools, equipment (hand and basic power tools), manpower and training requirements that personnel trained to the operations levels can use to undertake basic to moderate rescue operations. This equipment may be carried on any first line fire or rescue apparatus. 
c.	First Response 
Identifies basic tools, equipment (mostly hand tools), manpower and training requirements that personnel trained to the awareness level can use to undertake basic technical rescue operations.  The equipment may be carried on any first line fire or rescue apparatus. 
II.	OVERVIEW 
A.	The purpose of the VRSR program in Pennsylvania is to provide statewide standards of rescue service equipment, personnel training and staffing, communications, reporting, and operations. The following Voluntary Rescue Service Recognition program will be offered to rescue services that wish to have their service recognized by the Pennsylvania Department of Health. 
B.	Voluntary recognition of rescue services involves assessment of factors which relate to the effective provision of rescue and shall include rescue service tool and equipment needs, minimum staffing of rescue vehicles, personnel, training, and certification requirements, communications, vehicle standards, and reporting. 
C.	There are three (3) categories of recognition available to recognize varying levels or rescue capability. The first level, First Response, is the minimum requirement for recognition. The higher levels of rescue recognition (Operations and Advanced) will be available to those providers of rescue service who currently meet or exceed the minimum requirements for rescue capabilities as defined in these rules and regulations. 
D.	The recognition program will be an ongoing program of the Department of Health. Therefore, rescue services, which currently do not meet the criteria for recognition, will have an opportunity to do so at a later date. The Department reserves the right to modify or discontinue the program. 
E.	Recognition by the Department means that a Rescue Service has met the requirements defined in this document and, therefore, deserves the privilege of displaying the “Seal of Recognition” decal. The attainment of the VRSR does not grant additional rights or privilege, such as a primary response area, by the Department. 
F.	When a rescue vehicle displays the voluntary recognition decal, it guarantees to the community it serves: 
1.	
That the rescue service met the standards of these guidelines at the time of inspection. 

2.	
That on each emergency rescue call, there are an appropriate minimum number of rescue and medical personnel, who: 

a.	
Have rescue tools and equipment to safely perform a rescue. 

b.	
Have the essential medical equipment to perform initial emergency medical care.  (See Appendix A-1 for medical equipment listing). 

c.	
Are able to effectively communicate with appropriate medical and other emergency personnel via telecommunications systems. 




III.	RECOGNITION PROCEDURE 
A.	Each rescue service wishing to apply for recognition shall submit an application on forms provided by the Department to the regional EMS Council in whose jurisdiction the service is located. 
1.	The application packet will consist of the following items:

After inspection, the Regional Council will submit to the EMS Office a copy of the completed recognition Checklist(s). 
D.	Upon receipt of the completed recognition Checklist(s), the EMS Office will review all of the applicant materials. If the applicant has successfully met all of the requirements, the EMS Office will return to the Regional Council the appropriate certificates and decals for presentation to the qualifying rescue service. 
E.	Services that do not qualify will be notified, by the Regional Council, of their deficiencies. Once corrected, the service may arrange with the Regional Council for a second inspection. 
1.	
Deficiencies found during an inspection can be corrected on the spot by the service and marked as so on the inspection form. 

2.	
Those deficiencies that are not immediately corrective will be so noted on the inspection form. 

3.	
There will be no provisional or temporary recognition issued by the Department. 

4.	
The service shall have 45 days to correct deficiencies. 


IV.	RERECOGNITION PROCEDURES 
A.	Recognition shall be effective for three (3) years from the date of issue. 
B.	The EMS Office shall notify the VRSR service within ninety (90) days prior to expiration date. 
C.	At the time of notification, a request for reinspection/rerecognition will be provided to the VRSR service.

documentation as required for initial inspection.

E.	The Regional Council shall coordinate the inspection process in Section II of these guidelines. 
F.	Rerecognition shall be valid for three (3) years.

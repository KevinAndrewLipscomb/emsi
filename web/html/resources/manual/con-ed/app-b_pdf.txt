The First Anticipated Offering of this course should be the month, date and year the applicant expects to hold the course for continuing education credit. 
The Length of the Course is the scheduled time of the program in hours. 
The Actual Class time is the time actually spent in the educational experience. Lunch and break time must be excluded from the course scheduled time. 
This course relates to the scope of practice should be completed to indicate the practitioner level of the course for which you are requesting continuing education credit (check the appropriate box). Complete the number of hours to the nearest half-hour that relate to Basic Life Support (BLS) and Advanced Life Support (ALS). These hours should include all hours from your course that relate to the National Standard Curricula as approved by Pennsylvania, even if they are not direct patient care issues. If there are scope of practice issues….or even if you are unsure if they are issues….record them here. It will be reviewed at the Regional Council and the EMS Office. 
The hours related to direct patient care education at the Basic Life Support (BLS) level and at the Advanced Life Support (ALS) level should be listed on the appropriate lines.  Direct patient care is considered care (including assessment) of an individual who is believed to be sick, injured, wounded or otherwise incapacitated and helpless and in need of immediate medical attention. It includes assessment and care provided both physically and emotionally, but does not include items such as response planning, legal aspects, communications, documentation, hazardous materials, emergency vehicle operations (EVOC), or other operational issues. 
The Intended Audience area must have all applicable boxes marked. 
Examples include: 
AHA ACLS courses - EMTs may not be recognized as AHA ACLS providers so this course 
is intended and credit given for EMT-P and PHRN providers. American College of Surgeons PHTLS courses - First Responders may not be recognized as 
PHTLS providers. 
Minimum Class Size should be provided only if the governing body for the course has a minimum class size requirement, or the applicant believes the nature of the course requires a minimum class number. It does not relate to the specific resource capabilities of the applicant.

COURSE LESSON PLAN 
This section identifies the required components for the lesson plans using the attached “Course Outline Form” and provides a checklist for the applicant. 
The lesson plan must include each of the components listed on the form. They should be presented on the form or in similar format to facilitate the rating process. Some programs may require variations from this format but must include all essential components. 
Course Title – This should be course title that appears on the application. 
Prerequisites - This would include the required DOH certification level(s) as well as successful completion of programs such as ACLS, BTLS, PHTLS program prior to their refresher programs. 
Course Objectives - May be the same as the NSC objectives.  In this instance, it is not necessary to list the objectives again, but you must indicate the content that you plan to present related to the objective. More commonly, course objectives will be related to, but different from, the NSC referenced objectives. The course objectives are typically the same for all students and are not designated to specific certification levels. For the ABC rigid splint course noted above, course objectives would be more specific than the NSC objectives related to splinting. One course objective would be related to NSC objectives for the three certification levels. The course objective, “Demonstrate the application of the ABC rigid splint,” would relate to NSC objectives FR Lesson 10, EMT 5-3.11, and EMT-P 3-1.125 and would be listed as one course objective. 
National Standard Curriculum (NSC) Objectives referenced by curriculum(s) and objective number(s) - Each NSC curriculum has numbered objectives.  Those that apply to the course should be 
reference.  
Example:  A two-hour program designed to familiarize prehospital personnel with the new  
ABC rigid splint might include the following:  
FR  Lesson 10 objectives  
EMT  5-3.1, 5-3.2, 5-3.4 through 5-3.8, and 5-3.11  
EMT-P  3-1.76 through 3-1.80, 3-1.82 and 3-1.125  

There is variation in how the curriculum identifies objective numbers. Reference numbers only need to be provided to reduce paperwork exchange.  This will facilitate accurate and timely assignment of hours. 
Content Outline should be in standard outline format with enough detail to adequately identify the information that will be taught in the course. Allotted time should be placed in the left hand margin. . 
Materials required should be listed in this category. Optional materials may be identified as such. If required instructional materials are designed for the specific course, a copy should be included with the lesson plan. A required student handout designed for the course should be provided for review. A chapter referenced from a commercially available text should not be provided. 
Instructor Requirements should identify the qualifications required of the primary instructor and secondary instructors if applicable.  If secondary instructors are required, an instructor to student ratio must be listed. Usually, the ratio should not exceed 1:6 for skill practice. 
Common notation for instructor requirements include: 
EMT-Instructor 
PHRN/EMT-P 
The Evaluation Mechanism is the test or method of evaluation and the criteria for successful completion of the test. Tests are not required. 
The Successful Completion Criteria are the requirements with which a student must comply in order to successfully complete the program, i.e. attain a 70% on a written examination, or satisfactorily complete the skills stations identified, or whatever guidelines that you use to determine that student has successfully completed your program and accomplished the objectives set forth for the course.  
The Certificate of Completion is a sample of the document that you will provide a student that successfully completes your course, which will serve as a student’s proof of attendance. This document should include the title of the course, the date(s) the course was held, length of the course in hours, the student’s name and a signature that validates the certificate. 

COURSE DISTRIBUTION INFORMATION 
Check the box that appropriately identifies the applicant’s intended method of distribution.  Sign and date this section, and print name and title to authorize the selected method of distribution. The author of the course, the author’s designee, or the owner of the program information should sign this area. Application made by a designee must accompany the application with documentation of authorization to submit the course for review. 

SECTION III - ROUTING

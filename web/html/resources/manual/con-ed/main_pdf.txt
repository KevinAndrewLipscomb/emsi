The Pennsylvania Department of Health (Department) developed  and adopted regulations, effective September 2, 1995, to facilitate implementation of Act 1994-82 (Act 82) amendments to the Emergency Medical Services Act 35 P.S. § 6921-6938.  In part, these regulations prescribe the continuing education requirements for prehospital personnel to satisfy when continuing education is employed as a route for recertification.  They also prescribe the continuing education requirements that must be satisfied to maintain medical command authorization. 
In July 1995, the Department formed the Certification/Recertification System Task Force to draft the EMS Continuing Education (Con-Ed Manual) as required by Act 82 of 1994.  The Task Force  is comprised of regional EMS council staff  representing all  areas of the state -- as well as urban, suburban, and rural EMS systems and representatives  from the Division of Emergency Medical Services Systems and the  Pennsylvania Emergency Health Services Council (PEHSC). The principle task given to the  Task Force was to assist the Department with the development of this Con-Ed Manual. 
This manual is designed to provide  information which should be helpful in aiding the EMS community to  make the transition to the regulatory scheme relevant to continuing education brought about by Act 82 and the ensuing regulations.  This manual does the following: 
1. 
Apprises prehospital personnel of continuing education options and requirements; 

2. 
Explains how  continuing education credit will be assigned to courses; 

3. 
Explains how continuing education records of prehospital personnel may be tracked. 


The Department appreciates the assistance received from the following individuals and organizations in developing this manual: 
Thomas J. Liebman, Task Force Chairman 
Executive Director, EMMCO East EMS Council Caroline L. Bowes, R.N., EMS Program Specialist 
Division of Emergency Medical Services Systems John Campos, Executive Director EMS of Northeastern Pennsylvania Sandra L. Jablonski, M.S.Ed., Executive Director Southern Alleghenies EMS Council, Inc. Janette Kearney, Assistant Director Pennsylvania EHS Council 
Donna Lebisley, Training Coordinator Philadelphia Regional EMS David Nicholas, Director of Prehospital Services Emergency Medical Service Institute Joseph Schmider, Executive Director, Bucks County EMS Council John Yingling, EMS Program Manager Lycoming, Tioga, Sullivan EMS Council


Region Number 


Approved Course Number 


Sequential Number Based on Date

Example: 19 1001 - 960001 - 06 This number indicates that the class is registered in the EMMCO East region (19), is approved course number 1001 (ACLS), is the first class registered in the calendar year 1996 (960001), and is being used to assign hours to an instructor (see the Registry System section, Student Tracking - Instructors, on page 26 for a more detailed explanation of these last two digits). The last two digits should remain blank if not for instructor use. 
The regional EMS council shall also provide the continuing education sponsor with Continuing Education Completion (Appendix F), Class Roster (Appendix D), and Class Evaluation Summary (Appendix E) forms. 

The EMS rules and regulations specify the requirements for the recertification of EMTs and first responders through continuing education;  and for continuing education necessary for EMT­paramedics and prehospital registered nurses to maintain medical command authorization.  These requirements are identified below. 

The first responders certification is valid for a period of three (3) years, subject to disciplinary action under section 11(j.1) of the act and § 1003.27 of the regulations (relating to disciplinary and corrective action). First responders may choose from two (2) methods of recertification: 
1.	
Successful completion of a practical and written examination prescribed by the
Department.


2.	
Completion of continuing education requirements. 


First responders who choose to recertify by completing continuing education shall fulfill the following requirements within their three (3) year certification period: 
	
Sixteen (16) credit hours of instruction provided by a continuing education sponsor in topics related to the scope of practice of a first responder. 

	
Attend a CPR course for adult, child, and infant that meets or exceeds Department standards for CPR programs. 


First responders who do not complete the  requirements within the three (3) year certification period above shall successfully complete the practical and written recertification examination to be recertified. 
First responders shall receive a report annually from the regional EMS council detailing the credit hours they have earned to date.  A sample of this report, called an EMS Provider Continuing Education Record is located in Appendix G.  When all of the requirements for recertification are met, first responders shall automatically receive their certificate and wallet card prior to the expiration date of their certification (but no earlier than 60 days prior to their expiration date).  It is important for first responders to carefully review their EMS Provider Continuing Education Record, and to report any discrepancies to the regional EMS council in which they are registered. 
No first responder is eligible to receive credit for the same course more than once in the three (3) year certification period, and credit hours earned may not be carried over into the next certification period. 

The EMTs certification is valid for a period of three (3) years, subject to disciplinary action under section 11(j.1) of the act and § 1003.27 of the regulations (relating to disciplinary and corrective action). EMTs may choose from two (2) methods of recertification: 
1.	
Successful completion of a practical and written examination prescribed by the
Department.


2.	
Completion of continuing education requirements. 


EMTs that choose to recertify by continuing education shall fulfill the following requirements within their three (3) year certification period: 
	
Twenty four (24) credit hours of instruction provided by a continuing education sponsor in topics related to the scope of practice of a EMT. 

	
Attend a CPR course for adult, child, and infant that meets or exceeds Department
standards for CPR programs.



EMTs that do not complete the above requirements within the three (3) year certification period shall complete the practical and written recertification examination to be recertified. 
EMTs shall receive at least annually a report from the  regional EMS council detailing the credit hours they have earned to date.  A sample of this report, called an EMS Provider Continuing Education Record is located in Appendix G.  When all of the requirements for recertification are met, EMTs shall automatically receive their certificate and wallet card prior to the expiration date of their certification (but no earlier than 60 days prior to their expiration date).  It is important for EMTs to carefully review their EMS Provider Continuing Education Record, and to report any discrepancies to the regional EMS council in which they are registered. 
No EMT is eligible to receive credit for the same course more than once in the three (3) year certification period, and credit hours earned may not be carried over into the next certification period. 

EMT-paramedics are permanently certified and prehospital registered nurses are permanently recognized.  They must, however, maintain current medical command authorization in order to provide ALS services.  The decision to grant, deny or restrict medical command authorization rests with the ALS service medical director. 
To be eligible to receive medical command authorization, EMT-paramedics and prehospital registered nurses shall (except in the calendar year in which initially certified or recognized) meet the following criteria: 
	
Complete, in each calendar year, eighteen (18) credit hours of continuing education provided by a continuing education sponsor. 

	
Attend a CPR course every two (2) years for adult, child, and infant that meets or exceeds Department standards for CPR programs. 


They shall receive, twice a year from the regional EMS council, the EMS Provider Continuing Education Record (Appendix G).  They are responsible to present this record to their ALS service medical director to remain eligible for medical command authorization.  The ALS service medical director may not extend medical command authorization to any EMT-paramedic or prehospital registered nurse who has not satisfied the criteria specified above. 
No EMT-paramedic or prehospital registered nurse is eligible to receive credit for the same course more than once in each calendar year, and credit hours earned may not be carried over into the next calendar year. 

Prehospital personnel who attend courses offered by any organization or agency with National or state accreditation to provide continuing education may apply to receive credit for these courses. The individual shall have the burden of demonstrating to the Department that these courses meet standards equivalent to those standards set forth in the Departments regulations.  Persons wishing to receive credit for these programs must submit the Continuing Education by Endorsement form (Appendix H) to the Department through the regional EMS council in which they are registered. 
The regional EMS council shall review the material submitted for accuracy and completeness, and then forward the Continuing Education by Endorsement form (Appendix H) along with a recommendation to the Department.  Information submitted shall be reviewed by the Department for approval or disapproval and assignment of continuing education credit hours if approved. The regional EMS council is responsible to notify the applicant of the Departments decision. An applicant denied credit for a training program for which credit is sought through endorsement, may request the Department to reconsider its decision, and shall provide reasons for the Department to reverse its decision. 

The Department shall assign continuing education hours using the following criteria based on the information submitted by the applicant on the New Course Approval Application  (Appendix B). 
Course Objectives: The course objectives shall be referenced to the applicable national 
standard basic or refresher curriculum (NSC).  For example, objectives on airway 
management shall be referenced in the NSC. Credit hours shall be assigned hour for hour for 
each course hour that can be referenced to a NSC objective.  The smallest denominator of 
time shall be 0.5 hours. 
Length of the Course:  Credit hours assigned to a course cannot exceed the length of the 
course. 
After a course is approved, the Department shall assign it a unique course number.  The course number shall be based on the general classification of the training program.  After the Department assigns credit hours and a course number, the Department, through the appropriate regional EMS council, shall notify the applicant.  If approved, the course will be included in a revised list of courses. See Attachment 1. 

The main goal of the registry system is to provide a user friendly, flexible method for tracking each prehospital provider  and his or her  continuing education record.  Each prehospital provider shall be able to attend  a class  anywhere in the Commonwealth and receive credit. 

To receive credit for continuing education earned, each  prehospital provider is responsible for completing a Continuing Education Completion Form correctly.  A sample form is found in Appendix F.  The following information is requested on the form: 

Name 


Department Issued Certification Number 


Class Number 


Level of Certification 


Change of Address (Yes/No Field) 


If yes, space for the address 


The Continuing Education Completion Form (Appendix F) will be submitted by the sponsor to the appropriate regional EMS council that issued the class number for processing. 
All continuing education records will be processed and maintained through the regional EMS councils as part of a statewide registry system.  Individual prehospital providers will receive a report, annually for FRs and EMTs, semi-annually for EMT-Ps and PHRNs.  The report will provide a detailed record of their continuing education hours accrued. 
It is the responsibility of the individual prehospital provider to review their report and notify their regional EMS council of any discrepancy.  It is also their responsibility to keep their regional EMS council apprised of any address changes. 

Prehospital personnel are eligible to receive continuing education credit for time spent providing instruction in initial and continuing education programs.  To receive credit for providing instruction the prehospital provider needs to follow a somewhat different process than the usual process to secure that credit. The prehospital provider who served as the instructor must submit a Continuing Education Completion Form following each class in which they taught. 
Instructors who are certified as EMT-paramedics  or recognized prehospital registered nurses are only eligible to receive a maximum of six (6) credit hours  per year for instructing in BLS level training programs.  Instructors certified as EMTs or first responders are eligible to receive full credit for hours of instruction. 

Teaching Continuing Education Class 
Prehospital personnel are eligible to receive continuing education credit for time spent providing instruction in initial and continuing education programs.  These programs can be offered as single or multiple session(s) class(es).  A single session continuing education class, is a class that is no longer than one day and is taught in one session.  A multiple session continuing education class, is a class that is divided into multiple sessions over at least two days. 
The instructor shall mark the hours taught in the last two digits (Instructor Hours) of the class number on the Continuing Education Completion Form. Credit may be awarded for one half hour (0.5) or up to the entire credit hours allowed for the course, for the time spent actually teaching. The hours marked must equal the number of hours shown on the Class Roster. 
Instructors participating in the remainder of a class as a student (after teaching their segment), shall also receive credit for the remainder of the class, if the class is one for which continuing education could otherwise be earned by the prehospital provider. 

Teaching DOH Certification/Recognition Programs 
This would apply to any Department approved class for certification, recognition or recertification that has not been registered as a continuing education program, but is sponsored by an accredited training institute.  First responder, EMT-Basic, EMT- paramedic, and prehospital registered nurse programs would fall into this category. Prehospital personnel who serve as instructors in these programs will not normally have easy access to the continuing education registry system.  Therefore, these persons will need to take extra steps to receive credit. They shall: 
1.	
Contact any  regional EMS council and request a Continuing Education Completion Form. 

2.	
Complete the Continuing Education Completion Form, using the class number assigned to the  program,  marking the last two digits (Instructor Hours) with the total number of hours taught. 

3.	
Submit the Continuing Education Completion Form,  and any documentation supporting the request to the regional EMS council in which the class was registered, within thirty 

(30) days from the last regular class session. 

4.	
The regional EMS council shall verify all of the material submitted, and  update the prehospital providers continuing education record.

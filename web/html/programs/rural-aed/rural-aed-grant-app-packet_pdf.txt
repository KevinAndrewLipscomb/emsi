<title>Rural AED Grant Application</title>
DATE:November 12, 2003 
SUBJECT:Rural Access to Emergency Devices Grant 03-04 
TO:Regional EMS Council Directors Thru: Margaret E. Trimble, Director EMS Office 
FROM:Andrew Gilger EMT-P 
Rescue and Special Programs Coordinator 
Emergency Medical Services Office 
 (717) 787-8740 
Attached you will find an updated application and instructions for this cycle of funding for the Rural Access to Emergency Devices Grant.  Additionally, a form letter of support is included. This form letter will need to be completed with the application in order to meet grant requirements.  Additions have been made to the application requirements based on grant reporting requirements.  These additions involve reporting all uses of devices placed as a result of this grant funding to the regional EMS councils, and ensuring that manufacturer maintenance requirements are being met over the long term of the project. 
Some other issues to keep in mind regarding this year’s program: 
•	
Monies are available for approximately 130 devices.  They will be awarded to the first 130 applications that meet requirements for grant supported AED placement. 

•	
As discussed at the September Directors Meeting, training/evaluation monies will be split evenly among the participating regional EMS councils. 

•	
In light of the reporting requirements, regions will need to submit annual reports to the EMS Office documenting use of devices placed with grant funding, the outcome of the use if possible, as well as, training initiatives funded with grant monies.  These will be similar to the information requested for this past years grant.  

•	
My goal is to make one order this year, if possible, in late January. 

•	
Please keep in mind how devices are dispersed in your region, where they were placed in the first cycle of funding, and the guidance given last year related to the number of cardiac arrests and response times; again paying particular attention to BLS services (QRS included) that do not carry AEDs at present. 


As information becomes available regarding the program, I will keep you posted.  Please advise me if a specific staff member will be dealing with this program so that I can communicate directly with them as necessary.  If you have any questions regarding this year’s grant, please contact me via email at agilger@state.pa.us 
Thank you in advance for your continued support and cooperation.

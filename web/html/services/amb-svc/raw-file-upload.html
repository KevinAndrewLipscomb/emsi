         The burden to submit and maintain complete, valid, timely PCR data rests with
            the ambulance service.&nbsp; Some electronic PCR solution providers
            may assume substantial portions of this burden from the ambulance
            service, but in such cases, it's up to the ambulance service to
            monitor the solution provider's compliance.

Sponsor says roster ALREADY SUBMITTED (<class_number/>)
This is an automatic notification from <application_name/>.

Continuing Education Sponsor <sponsor_number/>, <sponsor_name/>, has indicated that the following class no longer needs to appear in <application_name/> because its roster has ALREADY BEEN SUBMITTED:

   Class #:
      <class_number/>
   Course title:
      <course_title/>
   Start:
      <start/>
   End:
      <end/>
   Length:
      <length/>
   Location:
      <location/>

It may be that no action from you is required.  This is a normal occurrence when your region has recently subscribed to <application_name/>, or when a sponsor used some non-<application_name/> mechanism to submit a roster.

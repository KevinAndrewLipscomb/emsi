<pre>                EMSCAN ASCII Record Specs
===========================================================
Output is in fixed-length ASCII format (one record per line):
Character fields are padded on the left with blanks.
Numeric fields are padded out on the left with zeroes.
Boolean fields are printed as strings of &quot;Y&quot;s and &quot;N&quot;s.
&quot;One-Of&quot; fields with more than 3 options are printed
as 2-digit numbers (4 to 15 choices) or 3-digit numbers 
if there are 16 or more possible choices.

<h2>Establishment guidelines</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>The following guidelines are for receiving hospitals, PSAPs, EMAs, and
  other organizations wishing to establish a Continuous FRED Monitoring Site at
  their facility.</p>
  <h3>Administrative/operational considerations</h3>
<ol>
  <li><p>Specific employee roles must be designated, empowered, informed, and
    available to react to alerts by entering the appropriate resource
    availability information into FRED.</p></li>
  <li>
      <p>There is no limit to the number of computers per facility on which FRED
      may run.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <p>The FRED monitoring computer may be used for any number of other
      applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Suitable locations for Continuous FRED Monitoring Sites include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Emergency Department nurse's station</li>
      <li>Emergency Department ambulatory triage room</li>
      <li>Emergency Department registration desk</li>
      <li>Security monitoring station</li>
      <li>Switchboard operator's station</li>
      <li>Pharmacy</li>
      <li>Nurse administrator's office</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  &nbsp;
  <li><p>Regardless of location, you should establish a FRED SOP that designates
    someone in charge of submitting resource data to FRED in case of an
    alert.&nbsp; This person may be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the Charge Nurse</li>
      <li>the on-call Nurse Administrator</li>
      <li>the Pit Boss</li>
      <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  &nbsp;
  <li><p>FRED can now issue alerts directly to alphanumeric pagers and
    text-enabled cellular telephones. </p></li>
</ol>
  <h3>Technical considerations</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Identify a computer system administrator to help implement this section.</p></li>
    <li><p>Identify a computer that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Runs Internet Explorer;</li>
        <li>Is always on;</li>
        <li>Has an always-on connection to the Internet;</li>
        <li>Is located within earshot of an always-staffed area;</li>
        <li>Has a reasonably loud internal or external speaker set.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The computer may be used for any number of other applications beside
      FRED.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>There is no limit to the number of computers per facility on which FRED
      may run.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Assure that the computer, its network connection, and its browser are
      configured to allow the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Unrestricted access to, and JavaScript execution on, &lt;http://*.miemss.org:80/*&gt;;
        </li>
        <li>
          Continuously inactive logins (although screensaver locking is
          acceptable);
        </li>
        <li>META REFRESH</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    &nbsp;
    <li><p>Put a shortcut to <a href="http://www.health.state.pa.us/fred/"> FRED</a>
      in the following places for All Users:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Startup folder</li>

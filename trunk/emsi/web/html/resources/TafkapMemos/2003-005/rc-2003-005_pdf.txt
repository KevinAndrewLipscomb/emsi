SUBJECT:  Ambulance Licensure Requirements:  
Defibrillator Requirement Change  
TO:  Regional EMS Councils  THRU: Director 
 EMS Office

EMS Program Specialist

(717) 787-8741  

Monophasic and biphasic monitor defibrillators have both been determined by the Commonwealth EMS Medical Director and the Medical Advisory Committee (MAC) to meet the equipment requirement for ambulance service licensure. The requirement in the Overview of Pennsylvania Department of Health Ambulance Service Licensure Program (Manual) should be corrected to reflect the change. 
Attached is page 27 of the manual that reflects the change made to #58 of the equipment requirements for licensure. The date that the change was made, March 18, 2003, can be found at the bottom of the page. Please substitute the new page in all copies of the ma nual that you have in your possession and notify all ambulance services within your region of this change. I have also included an updated change page to replace the existing change page at the beginning of the manual.

To all service providers in EMSI's region: 
EMSI engages Far View Group to study bioterrorism preparedness 
EMSI is engaged in a study to determine the Bio-terrorism readiness of the EMS provider agencies in the western Pennsylvania region.  EMSI has contracted the services of a consulting agency, Far View Group, (FVG) to complete certain aspects of this study. 

Phone surveys authorized 
We have authorized FVG to contact a random group of members within the region to gather information for the report.  Specifically, FVG will be asking provider agencies about training, equipment, policies/guidelines, mutual aid agreements and interoperability issues as they relate to bio-terrorism.  We ask that if contacted you accommodate FVG with a 10-minute phone survey or internet (email) survey. 

Impact of project 
The results of this study are important to you as a service provider.  This information will guide the Council and the state EMS office in decisions regarding training and equipment needs of the council agencies. This year, several million dollars will be flowing into each state to better prepare emergency service providers like to respond to terrorism events. 
Please assist us in gathering the information necessary to attract those funds to this EMS Council. 
Sincerely, 
Kevin A. Lipscomb Assistant Executive Director

Introduction

This document has been prepared by the Emergency Medical Services Office (EMS Office) of the Department of Health (Department)) to assist entities that seek to have a Special Event EMS Plan evaluated by the Department.  A Special Event EMS Plan may be submitted for a planned and organized activity or contest which will place participants or attendees, or both, in a defined geographic area in which the potential need for EMS exceeds local EMS capabilities, or where access by emergency vehicles might be delayed due to crowd or traffic congestion at or near the event. 
This document is not itself a regulation, and consequently it does not have the force or effect of law. Furthermore, although the EMS Office may revise this document from time to time to keep it up to date, statutory, regulatory or policy changes may occur following the distribution of this document and later revisions.  Therefore, interested persons are encouraged to review a current copy of the Emergency Medical Services Act and the Department’s regulations and to confer with the appropriate regional emergency medical services (EMS) council to secure additional assistance.  An interested person may log onto the Department’s website at www.health.state.pa.us to secure the most up-to-date copy of this document.  Special Event EMS regulations are set forth at 28 Pa. Code §§1013.1-1013.8. 

Plan Information and Submission 
To secure review of a Special Event EMS Plan, an entity must submit the plan on the form found in Attachment A.  This form solicits information specified in 28 Pa. Code §1013.1. A copy of that section of the regulations may be obtained from a regional EMS council listed in Attachment B.  If an entity chooses to submit a plan for review by the EMS Office, it must do the following: 
1.	
Submit the plan to the appropriate regional EMS council for review at least 90 days prior to the event, or first event in a series of events. 

2.	
Make corrections, if any, identified by the regional EMS council. 

3.	
Consider recommendations by the regional EMS council for plan improvement 

4.	
If any revisions are made, resubmit the revised plan to the regional EMS council for review and transmission to the EMS Office. 


The submission of a Special Event EMS Plan to the Department through a regional EMS council does not relieve the entity of any responsibility it may have to submit a similar plan to the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA).  The entity should contact PEMA at (717) 651-2001 or (800) 424-7362 (for calls made within Pennsylvania) or e-mail (PEMA) at stateeoc@state.pa.us. The entity should also contact the county emergency management agency in the county where the event will be held to inquire about any local requirements. 

Plan Approval
 After the plan has been reviewed by the regional EMS council and is determined by that council to be complete and accurate, that council will forward the plan to the EMS Office for review and approval or disapproval.  The EMS Office will complete its review within 60 days after the regional EMS council determines that it has received a complete and accurate plan. If approved by the EMS Office, a copy of the plan will be returned to the regional EMS council through which it was submitted, together with documentation to verify that it has been approved.  The regional EMS council will then provide an approved copy of the plan to the entity that submitted it. 

Post Event Reporting 
If an entity participates in the Special Event EMS Plan and it has been approved, 28 Pa. Code §1013.8 requires the entity to complete special event report form after the event has occurred. This report form labeled “Post Event Reporting Form” is appended hereto as Attachment C. Within 30 days following the special event, the entity must complete the form and submit it to the regional EMS council to which the Special Event EMS Plan was submitted.  That regional EMS council will review the report for completeness.  Once complete, the council will forward it to the EMS Office.  After reviewing the report, either the regional EMS council or the EMS office may make recommendations to the event organizer for areas of improvement.

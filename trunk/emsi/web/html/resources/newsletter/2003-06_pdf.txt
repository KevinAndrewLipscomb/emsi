Precautions Outlined for Transport of SARS Patients 

he outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Asia, Europe and North America has created concerns among health care and EMS personnel regarding the transaction of the disease. A number of health care workers have contracted the disease from interaction with patients. In addition, EMS personnel involved in the transport of SARS patients to medical facilities are considered at risk for infection. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently released recommendations for EMS providers to manage suspected SARS patients while ensuring the safety of transport personnel. These recommendations are based on standard infection control practices and available epidemiologic information regarding the transmission of SARS. 
The CDC currently recommends that Standard precautions, with eye protection to prevent droplet exposure, as well as Contact and Airborne precautions be taken in dealing with potential SARS cases. In addition, respiratory protection using respirators providing at least 95 filtering efficiency (e.g. N-95) with appropriate fit-testing is recommended.

drinking, application of cosmetics, and handling of contact lenses, should not be performed during patient transport. 
Protective Equipment 

•Disposablenon-sterile gloves must be worn for all patient contact. Gloves should be removed and discarded in biohazard bags after patient care is completed 
• 
Drivers who provide direct patient care, including moving patients on stretchers, should wear a disposable gown, eye-protection, and gloves as described above during patient care activities. Gowns and gloves are not required for personnel whose duties are strictly limited to driving. 

•
Vehicles that have separate driver and patient compartments and can provide separate ventilation to these areas are preferred for transport of possible SARS patients. If a vehicle without separate compartments and ventilation must be used, the outside air vents in the driver compartment should be open, and the rear exhaust ventilation fans should be turned on at the highest setting during transport of SARS patients to provide relative negative pressure in the patient care compartment. 

• 
Oxygen delivery with non-rebreather facemasks may be used for patient oxygen support during transport. 

• 
The patient may wear a paper surgical mask to reduce droplet production. 

• 
Positive pressure ventilation should be performed using a resuscitation bag-valve mask, preferably one equipped to provide HEPA or equivalent filtration of expired air. 

• 
Cough-generating procedures should be avoided during pre-hospital care (e.g., nebulizer treatments). 

• 
EMS organizations should consult their ventilator equipment manufacturer to confirm appropriate filtration capability and the effect of filtration on positive pressure ventilation. Mechanical ventilators for SARS-patient transport should provide HEPA or equivalent filtration of airflow exhaust. 


The CDC has also made the following recommendations for EMS personnel transporting potential SARS patients: 
General 
• 
Suspected SARS patients should be transported using the minimum number of EMS personnel and without non-SARS patients or passengers in the vehicle. 

• 
Receiving facilities must be notified prior to arrival of suspected SARS patients to facilitate preparation of appropriate infection control procedures and facilities. 

• 
SARS may be transmitted if residual infectious particles on environmental surfaces are brought into direct contact with the eyes, nose or mouth, or by unwashed hands. Hand hygiene is of primary importance using protective equipment throughout transport of a suspected SARS patient. 

• 
Personal activities, including eating, 



or when soiled or damaged. Hands must be washed or disinfected with a waterless hand sanitizer immediately after removal of gloves. 
•
 Disposable fluid-resistant gowns should be worn for all direct patient care. Gowns should be removed and discarded in biohazard bags after patient care is completed or when soiled or damaged. 

• 
Eye-protection must be worn in the patient-care compartment and when working within six feet of the patient. Corrective eyeglasses alone are not appropriate protection. 

• 
The door/window between driver and patient compartments should be closed before a suspected SARS patient is brought onboard. N-95 (or greater) respirators should be worn by the driver if the driver’s compartment is open to the patient-care compartment.

Antidotes for Agents of Chemical
Terrorism Recommendations Made


se of chemical weapons by terrorists is a real threat to Americans, and EMS personnel are at the front line in plans to offer antidotes for these agents should an event occur. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recently approved pralidoxime and sodium thiosulfate as exceptions to the ALS drug list. These drugs are approved antidotes for nerve agents and cyanide. 
According to a Pennsylvania Department of Health memo, pralidoxime (2-PAM) and atropine are approved antidotes that are now part of the Mark 1 autoin­jector kits used by ALS personnel. These two components should be used in the initial treatment for patients with symptoms of nerve agent exposure and may be given by individual injection or with the autoinjector kids. Generally, one kit is used to treat mild or moderate symptoms; three for moderate to severe symptoms. Should a seizure occur, diazepam should be administered. 
Also, sodium thiosulfate is a used to treat cyanide. It is now a component of the cyanide kits and is the only drug approved by the HHS for this purpose. 
The kits have been approved by the state and continuing education training on administering these antidotes at the local level will be forthcoming. The course will be completed as a traditional continuing education lecture using the Learning Management System. EMS treatment protocols and information on access to these medications will be developed and discussed at that time. 
For more information on the use of anti­dotes for agents of chemical terrorism, contact the EMSI office at 412-242-7322.

Services Asked to Enter Information in




Licensure Data Bank


Licensure Data Bank has been developed by the Pennsylvania Department of Health through the Emergency Medical Services Office. All ambulance services should be submitting their data to this bank electronically when applying for an initial license, license renewal, or amendment of an existing license. For renewals, the process must be completed between 60-120 days prior to expiration of a current license. Utilizing the user-friendly electronic process, services will benefit from the expedited process that allows the EMS office to provide timely information for emergency preparedness and funding opportunities. 

Ambulance services that want to use the new system must have Internet access and an e-mail address. If these are not available, services should contact their EMS council. 
To register, log on to http://ecapps.health. state.pa.us/emso and click on the “click here to begin” link. Participants will need to login and register an account by clicking on the “register” button. Prompts will lead the participant through the remainder of the process. 
For more information or answers to questions regarding electronic registrations, contact the EMSI office at 412-242-7322 or Robert H. Gaumer, EMS Office, 717-787-8740 or EMSquestion@state.pa.us. 


DNR Update: Out-of-State Physician Signature Instructions 

he recent changes in the Do-Not-Resuscitate Act, Act 59, present clear instructions on the issuance, administration and revocation of out-of-hospital DNR orders. As part of the new rulings, the patient’s attending physician provides a patient with an out-of-hospital DNR order, bracelet or necklace that EMS personnel are to honor when a terminally ill patient experiences cardiac or respiratory arrest. 
What is not quite so clear in the new regulations is the procedures for out-of-state patients with DNR orders. Under the DNR Act, the EMS provider is empowered to withhold CPR upon observing an out-of-hospital DNR order, bracelet or necklace displayed by the patient. In Pennsylvania, a physician’s signature is required and must be displayed as part of the order. Although the Pennsylvania statute allows for out-of-state hospital DNR orders, no other states have been identified that require the physician signature that is deemed essential by the Commonwealth. Because of this, these DNR orders can not be recognized. 
The Pennsylvania Department of Health is working on developing procedures and a list of states with signature requirements. This information will be provided to EMS personnel when available so documentation is clear on out-of-state patient DNR procedures. In the meantime, ambulance personnel should write down the name of the physician listed on the DNR tag to ensure a physician’s order is present and that all procedures have been properly followed in accordance with Act 59. 
For more information on the new DNR act, visit http://webserver.health.state.pa.us, and under Health Topics A-Z, click Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) Orders. 



EMSI Offers New and Improved Web Site


MSI’s web site, www.emsi04.org, is growing by leaps and bounds. What was once little more than a five page online brochure is rapidly becoming a dynamic site containing dozens of pages and scores of useful features. 
Many changes are evident on the site’s main page, where visitors will see the mission statement, a set of hot links (the most commonly requested items), and a block of timely EMS news items of regional interest. There are also quick links to the state EMS office, to other regional EMS councils, and to county EMS councils in our region. 
At the top of every page, there are phone numbers and EMSI’s street address. There’s even a link to a map that shows how to get to the office. Also, in the left margin of each page, visitors will find links to the site’s major areas of interest. 
The deepest and broadest content can be found under the Services link in the left margin. This page leads to other pages organized by constituency: pre-hospital personnel, ambulance services, medical directors, medical command facilities and physicians, con-ed sponsors, training institutions, researchers, PSAPs, rescue technicians and the general public. Each constituency can click an adjacent link to find information tailored to its particular needs or interests. 
For instance, on the pre-hospital personnel page, there are links to an interactive list of course offerings and to several forms and documents commonly needed by EMTs and paramedics. On the ambulance services page, there are links to checklists and manuals relating to inspection, licensure, electronic PCR software, and more. Elsewhere on the site, content is similarly grouped by constituency. 

As new pages are added, the site’s search feature, always available in the top margin, gains importance. EMSI is working with its web site vendor to make this feature more useful. 
The bulk of the improvements to the site obey four basic rules: 
• 
All pages have a consistent look and feel to encourage visitors to stay awhile and learn about EMSI. 

• 
Pages and links are arranged according to the different constituencies served by EMSI. 


• 
The content of each page is related to EMSI’s tasking from the state and from its own Board of Directors. 

• 
New content from any EMSI staff member or partner, regardless of the contributor’s web authoring talent, can be added without violating the first three rules. 


In the near future, EMSI expects to add interactive pages that will allow many kinds of regional council business to be conducted entirely online. For example, one such page will allow safe, consistent uploading of electronic PCR data. 
If you haven’t done so lately, visit www.emsi04.org today and see what is new and interesting on this great site.

Legislation Offers Compensation
for Smallpox Vaccination Injury


n the last issue of Intercom, detailed information on the Pennsylvania Smallpox Vaccination Plan was presented. The plan calls for the advance inoculation of health care workers and first responders in the event of an outbreak. In late April, President Bush signed into law a compensation package for those individuals participating in the federal program who may be injured by smallpox vaccinations. The new law calls for the following coverage: 
• 
Individuals permanently disabled by the vaccine to receive up to $50,000 per year, with no cap on lifetime compensation. 

• 
Individuals with less serious injury to receive up to $50,000 per year, with a $262,100 lifetime cap. 

• 
Spouses of individuals who die due to the administration of the vaccine to receive a lump sum of $262,100; their children to receive a lump sum of $262,100 or $50,000 per year until age 18. 


Funding for the compensation program is estimated at $42 million and will be available for public health and health care workers who participate in the first phase of the vaccination program. This includes emergency, health care workers and other official personnel who volunteer to be part of the Smallpox Response Team. Phase 2, which has not yet been initiated, will include the voluntary inoculation of EMS, firefighters and law enforcement personnel. 
Currently, EMS services that would be designated as smallpox capable in an emergency are being identified. Personnel within these designated services are encouraged by the Emergency Management Services Office (EMSO) to go through the screening process to determine eligibility for vaccination. Although an inoculation program is not underway yet for first responders, determining eligibility for voluntarily receiving the vaccination is a step that can be taken early. 
For more information on the smallpox vaccination plan, the compensation legislation, or EMS smallpox capable services, contact EMSI at 412-242-7322.

For more information on the testing dates or to check for available testing slots, contact EMSI at 412-242-7322. 


Correction


n a recent issue of Intercom, it was inadvertently reported that ambulance services are not required by the Pennsylvania Department of Health to complete a form for every ambulance accident that occurs. According to the state codes, ambulance service are, in fact, required to “report to the appropriate regional EMS council, in a form and manner prescribed by the Department, any ambulance vehicle accident.” 
The EMS Office has provided each regional EMS council with a copy of the form developed by Southern Alleghenies EMS Council. This form should be used by all regional ambulance services to report accidents to the EMSI office, which will forward it to the EMS Office. 
The form is now available at EMSI’s web site, www.emsi04.org. For more information on reporting ambulance accidents, or to obtain a paper copy of the form, contact EMSI at 412-242-7322. 

Report on Ambulance Licensures 
During the period of February through April 2003, EMSI’s field staff conducted inspections on the following EMS providers in the region. All providers met the requirements established by the Pennsylvania Department of Health. 
Regular licenses were issued to: 
Beaver County 
Hanover VFD Ambulance

EMS Update 2003 – Good Training and Great Fun



MS Update 2003 was an event to remember. It was a record breaking year for 
the 16th annual conference with 743 registrants and approximately 1,100 people visiting 50 exhibits over the two days. In the midst of it all, participants and their families enjoyed a weekend of learning, training and good times. 
The hot topics at the conference included pediatric emergencies, sports injuries, information on treating patients who have overdosed on heroin and/or ecstasy, patient assessment, and the new federal guidelines on patient privacy (HIPAA). 
Information on the new DNR regulations was distributed to attendees as well. 
Mary Popovich of Perryopolis EMS was honored with the 2003 EMS Practitioner of the Year Award for her 30 plus years of emergency medical service to the community. Also at the conference, EMSI’s grant awardees received recognition (see story on opposite page). 
Mark your calendars now for next year’s great event to be held March 25-27 at Seven Springs Resort. Preliminary information will be available in October on the EMSI web site.

Community Partnership Formed to Study AEDs in Rural Areas; Funding Available in January 

lthough the initial application deadline has passed, rural services that are interested in having Automatic External Defibrillators (AEDs) available in their communities will have a chance to apply again for funding next year. AEDs are life-saving treatment devices in ambulances for patients suffering from cardiac arrest. However, in rural areas, their effectiveness is limited due to the longer distances EMS units must travel to reach the patient. Because of this, there is a need to find a way to make AEDs accessible for individuals who treat patients in these areas. A statewide community partnership has begun initial evaluation and identifi­cation of first responders and community members to determine the best locations to place AEDs and to provide training and other resources to hospi­tals and ambulance services. Applications were recently accepted for the pro­vision of AEDs with an AED medical director to rural ambulance services with an emergency response area. 

Look for more information on how to apply in the future. For additional information on the status of this project, contact the EMSI office at 412-242-7322.

Jerry "Mr. Ambulance" Esposito Dies


erry Esposito, a local and national EMS legend who was known for his caring commitment to the community, passed away on March 31 after an extended illness. 
Esposito retired as the director of Citizen's Ambulance in Indiana County in 1992 after a lifetime of service as an EMT and EMT trainer. He was known nationwide as a consultant for ambu­lances and worked tirelessly at the state and local level. 
He founded the Paramedic Journal, which was the statewide ambulance association; directed the Allegheny County Council of Emergency Health Services (now EMSI); and sat on more than 25 state, national and global com­mittees and organizations. 
Esposito is also well known for his work with Dr. Peter Safar to help redesign the shape and function of ambulances. His innovative work is evi­dent in today's ambulances. Much of what he learned came from his early experiences, not only at Citizen's, but also from when he opened his first ambulance service out of his home in Punxsutawny using his station wagon as an ambulance. 


221 Penn Avenue Suite 2500 Pittsburgh, PA 15221 
(412) 242-7322 
In an obituary in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, friends and family reminisced about the man who gave his heart and soul to the EMS profession. 
"It is impossible to describe the count­less number of people that he educated, coordinated and encouraged," said B.J. Pino, Citizens' chief operating officer and a former EMT, in the obituary. "Jerry told me on several occasions that he had experienced a 'good life,' one that was fulfilling, especially with his wonderful family and unique career. He was right."

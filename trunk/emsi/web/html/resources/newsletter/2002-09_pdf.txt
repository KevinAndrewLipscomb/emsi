Anatomy of Disorder:
Chaos from Confusion

By Joseph Ponko – Medical Specialist, EMSI 

n May 31, 2002 at approximately 1857, the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh issued a tornado watch to the region. About eight minutes prior to that, I became involved in a mass casualty incident at Kennywood Amusement Park that was a result of a “macro burst” and what the local media called the Kennywood Collapse. 
Thousands of people from across the region were visiting Kennywood on that date. Storms were developing throughout the late afternoon and Kennywood initiated its standard severe weather policy where the amusement rides, shops, refreshment stands, and general areas of the park are shut down or used as shelters. 
As the skies turned dark and the wind picked up, a freak weather occurrence known as a macro burst was winding its way through West Mifflin. A few short moments later, the area around Kennywood was turned into a disaster zone with electricity out, buildings toppled, and trees uprooted. Inside Kennywood, the roof of the Whip ride was picked up from its foundation and thrown approximately 20 feet against a wrought iron fence. The power went off; 100-year-old trees were uprooted; signs and banners were flung about the park; rides were damaged from falling debris. 
The Whip had just shut down and guests were preparing to leave when the storm hit. Many sought shelter in the cars of the Whip or in nearby

Anatomy of Disorder continued from cover 
buildings. As the storm was still circulating through the park, ride operators began calling the communications center at the park to announce there were injured guests and several rides suffered damage. 
This was the start of the MCI. What hap­pened at the scene and what did I learn? 
The MCI response plan at Kennywood is based on several factors including guest safety and crowd control. When first notified of the Whip collapse, members 
of the operations and 

dispatched to several areas of the park because of widespread injuries, power outages, and storm damage. At the same time, the elec­tricity and phone lines went down (both land­line and cellular). Hail and rain made portable The first ambulance arrived on the scene at 1859 and was quickly followed by many ambulance units from across the southern tier of the county. Dozens of regional services arrived and provided the necessary equipment to continue treating the patients: backboards, soft tissue bandages, cervical collars, and immobilization devices. 
Triaging determined that about a dozen patients were immediate transports; about 20 patients were classified as yellow or secondary transport; and about 20 addi­tional patients were triaged as green (delayed). Approximately 47 patients, including 12 pediatric patients, were transported to local hospitals. 
A few days after the event, several of us met to debrief and find out how we can better handle these situations. 
The first ambulance arrived on scene in less than seven minutes after the first 911 call. Patients were already being treated in the first aid room; triage was underway at other areas of the park. Prism EMS arrived on scene first. Rescue services, including Monroeville VFD, arrived quickly afterward and began the rescue of patients in the collapsed building. 
One of the initial benefits of maintaining strong relationships with local EMS per­sonnel is quick access to the Pittsburgh Critical Incident Stress Debriefing team. Four members of this team arrived at the scene and immediately set up an area for EMS providers and Kennywood employees who wanted to talk. The team stayed until 2326 when all responders were deactivated. They were back on the scene at dawn as hundreds of Kennywood employees began cleaning up the park and getting it ready for their customers. 
had no idea of the num­ber of patients in the park until we began triaging and searching each sector. When we called for an ambulance at 1852, it was announced as building collapse at Kennywood with unknown number of patients. 
People had facial injuries, musculoskeletal pain, and soft tissue injuries. Our re­sources were stretched. A call from Allegheny County EOC went out at 1906 for all available ambulance units to respond. The EMS personnel at the park began triaging patients and we were quickly joined by two additional EMS providers who assisted in treating the “walking wounded.” Additional staff members quickly arrived to assist in treating patients, providing support, and keeping us stocked with supplies. 

Allegheny County EOC and 911 initiated their disaster plan. Regional resources were deployed within minutes. Public transit buses were sent and generators brought in. Local restaurants hit just as hard donated drinks and food to the public safety providers. Local agencies were also dealing with damage in their normal service areas and were monitoring two and three situations at once. 
Fortunately, egos were left at the door during the MCI. With so many person­nel on the scene, including EMS, fire, police, rescue and CISD, there’s always the chance that everyone would want to be the chief and no one would actually do any work. In the event, services worked well with each other; personnel from competing services helped carry patients on backboards to waiting ambulances; and 18-year-old Kennywood employees assisted seasoned EMS per­sonnel in log-rolling patients onto backboards and holding oxygen tanks. 
Of course there were problems and issues that arose that years of MCI management training really never prepared us for. 
Three command areas were set up as injuries necessitated three treatment areas; there was no one space where all the injured were located. This created no delay, but did cause frayed nerves among many of the providers as we waited for additional supplies. Unfortunately, communication between the areas was sporadic, yet all patients were treated and transported quickly and efficiently. In hindsight, everyone agreed that it would have been better to have one command center with designated people in familiar roles. This time, our fractured system worked and did not cause any delays, yet we realize that additional training needs to be done. 
As many EMS units arrived on scene, a staging area away from the incident was not set up due to communication failures. Ambulances were double parked on the side of Route 837 (Kennywood Blvd.). It did not delay patient transports, but created a picture of confusion that made the scene look much more horrendous on the evening news. 
Communications broke down as cell phones were rendered useless until contact could be made with local companies to increase the number of open lines. Regular phones were intermittent and spotty at best. Portable radios were mal­functioning as responding agencies were not on the same channels. This did not delay patient triage, treatment or trans­port as we were still able to communicate without radios. Future plans will ensure everyone at the scene can communicate. 
The weather was still not cooperative. As the initial call came in, we responded to the injured as winds reached 105 mph and marble-sized hail was hitting us. Throughout the incident, the rain fell, creating additional hazards. We had to be more careful as we walked and car­ried patients. Surprisingly, seconds after the storm hit, the weather was strangely quiet and somewhat peaceful. We have heard stories from tornado survivors who recall the same experience. 
The media arrived in record time. Kennywood security and West Mifflin Police performed admirably in main­taining crowd control. The media set up in the handicapped parking lot across the street. Many guests were shown being interviewed leaving the park throughout the evening newscasts. 
Notification to hospitals was practically non-existent. Of the patients transported, only five ambulances contacted the hos­pitals to inform them of the wounded. Hospital staff had heard of the accident and all initiated their disaster plans, anticipating dozens if not hundreds of patients. Unfortunately, the hospitals were never brought into the MCI loop and had to rely on the television and radio news to keep them informed. A communi­cations officer was a necessity. Once again this lack of communication did not cause any patient-related problems. 

Plans are being made to better educate everyone in the event something of this magnitude ever happens again. Additional training will be a part; drills are being looked at as an item of training. 
AJ Heightman, editor of JEMS, said it best in his June 2000 article 20 Tips for MCI Management, “MCIs are noisy, chaotic, demanding and emotional.” 
I have been involved in EMS for 11 years and this was my first MCI. In a way, I hope it is my last. If not, we will respond even better next time. 
Editor’s note: A.J. Heightman, editor of JEMS 
magazine, will be a featured speaker at 
EMS Update 2003 to be held March 27-29 
at Seven Springs Resort. His one-day MCI 
seminar will be presented.

Study Results in VRC Changes 

pilot test to study a new standardized vehicle rescue curriculum (VRC) began in July that has resulted in changes to the curriculum. The Pennsylvania Department of Health and the State Fire Academy have signed an agreement to test the curriculum over an 18-month period. 
During this time, the program will feature three levels of training: awareness, operations and technician. These levels will each consist of 16 instructional hours. A complete 48-hour class may result if the three modules are run consecutively. 
One of the major changes in the cur­riculum includes the standardization of criteria for both primary and assistant instructors. Primary instructors must now complete the new combined cur­riculum rollout, be currently approved by either agency, be certified as a Pennsylvania EMT or higher, be certified as a Fire Fighter I or completed Essentials of Fire Fighting, and have a certificate from Educational Methodology or the equivalent. Assistant Instructors must now complete the new combined curriculum rollout, be certified as a Pennsylvania EMT or Fire Fighter 1 or completed Essentials of Fire Fighting, and have a certificate from Educational Methodology or the equivalent. 
All instructors should be aware of the changes and need to be trained in order to meet these criteria. For more information on upcoming courses for staff upgrading, contact EMSI at (412) 242-7322

security alert earlier 

this year based on several reports indicating threats involving possible unauthorized use of vehicles or uniforms. 
In one case in New Jersey, individuals acting suspiciously offered cash for a replica ambulance at a shop that builds copies of emergency vehicles, police cars and fire trucks. This prompted officials in New York to issue an alert on the potential for terrorists to use emergency vehicles as car bombs that can be planted near government buildings or landmarks without drawing attention. Other incidences have involved various inquiries about EMS operations and organizations via e-mail. 
Since EMS personnel and organizations offer a high level of public trust, the opportunity exists for terrorists to exploit that trust by portraying themselves as EMS personnel or by using vehicles and uniforms in the wrong manner, according to NAEMT President Nathan R. Williams. NAEMT has developed a reference document to aid EMS organizations in assessing vul­nerability and corrective measures to be 
•
 Do not leave unattendedvehicles running or with the keys left in the ignition. 

•
 Conduct routine and random vehicleaudits to ensure vehicles in EMS stations are secure and not available for unauthorized access. 

•
 Develop and monitor station keyaccess logs through routine and random checks. Conduct inventories to account for all keys – any keys that are missing should be located immediately. 

•
 Ensure that any vehicle that is off thepremises for service at repair facilities is accounted for at all times. Discuss security measures with the repair facilities and vendors to ensure that the vehicle is indoors overnight or when the facility is closed; that there are no keys left in the vehicle; and that the vehicle is not taken off the premise for any reason not related to the repair. Any unusual interest in the vehicle should be reported to the EMS organization or local law enforcement officials. 


•
 Strip agency identifying marks onvehicles that are decommissioned and slated for resale, except to other bona fide emergency response organizations. Consider uninstalling emergency warning devices and other EMS markings.

 Incorporate a photo of the authorizedmember in identification credentials. 

•
 Work with uniform store vendors to establish and verify the identity of individuals seeking to buy uniform articles. Verification can be made using identification credentials or by providing a contact number of the agency to cross check the identity against a database of authorized active members.

VRSR Certifications Presented to Eight Services


ight services from across the region received their Voluntary Rescue Service Recognition (VRSR) certifications in June. The certifications were presented by Phil Stoner, executive director of EMSI. The services that received this recognition were: Baldwin EMS, Bentleyville VFD, Claysville VFD, Guyasuta VFD, McDonald VFD, Midway VFD, Peters Township VFD and Ross West View EMS. 
The purpose of the VRSR program, a joint program through the Pennsylvania Department of Health EMS Office and the Office of the State Fire Commissioner, is to provide statewide standards of rescue service equipment, personnel training and staffing, communications, reporting and operations. 
Voluntary recognition of rescue services involves assessment of factors that relate to the effective provision of rescue. It includes rescue service tool and equip­ment needs, minimum staffing of rescue vehicles, personnel, training and certifi­cation requirements, communications, vehicle standards and reporting. 
There are three categories of recognition available for varying levels of rescue capability. The first level, First Response, is the minimum requirement for recog­nition. The higher levels of rescue recognition, Operations and Advanced, are available to those providers of rescue service who currently meet or exceed the minimum requirements for rescue capabilities as defined in the Pennsylvania Department of Health rules and regulations. 

Phil Stoner, executive director of EMSI, presents a VRSR certificate to Bill Plunkett, Baldwin EMS director. 
Recognition by the Department means • The rescue service on a call has the that a rescue service has met the essential medical equipment to per­requirements defined in the program. form initial emergency medical care.

national average for

Unfortunately, in the northeast (including 
Pennsylvania), the rate is only 62 percent, down five percent from the fall of 2000. 
The disparity in numbers 
between the north east and 
the rest of the country may 
be due to enforcement, 
according to the newsletter article. Most southern states participated in efforts to “click it or ticket,” which boosted seat belt use nine percent. Low penalties that are not significant deterrents may also account for the low numbers in the north east, according to the article. Finally, standard enforcement that allows law enforcement officers to stop a vehicle if a driver or passenger is not buckled up accounted for an 11 percent increase in seat belt use. 
Encouraging law makers to pass standard enforce­ment laws can go a long way toward increasing safety belt use and consequently saving lives. If such sweep­ing changes are made, then the north east could make a turnaround and see growth in the usage similar to what other parts of the country have experienced over the past several years.

Lorazepam and Storage in Hot Weather 


he PA Department of Health has added the drug lorazepam (Ativan®) to the state ALS drug list for the treatment of epileptic seizures and sedation of violent patients. However, the State warns that the potency of lorazepam can be dramatically reduced by heat and recommends refrigerated storage in the pre-hospital setting. 
In a 1999 study, both diazepam (Valium®) and lorazepam (Ativan®) lost potency as the storage temperature increased; lorazepam degraded dramatically at temperatures over 30ºC (86ºF). The potency of lorazepam remained at 100 
percent when refrigerated, 90 percent at 
room temperatures below 30ºC 
(86ºF), and only 25 percent when stored at 37ºC (98.6ºF). In addition to the dramatic degra­
dation of lorazepam at high temperatures, this study points out that 
diazepam also degrades to a lesser extent at high temperatures. 
Because of these findings, the Department of Health has issued the following recommendations that must be followed by services that carry lorazepam. 
•
 Protect lorazepam from light during storage by keeping the drug in the light-protected carton or equivalent. 

•
 Secure lorazepam in the same manner as narcotic medications since it is a controlled substance. 

•
 Carry lorazepam in a refrigerated, temperature-controlled compart­ment on the EMS vehicle (this is the ideal method of storage) or dis­carded and replace every 60 days. An additional label must be affixed to the medication vial to assure that the new 60-day replacement date is apparent. 


Services choosing to add this drug to their drug boxes must follow applicable regional drug use policies and protocols. All ALS practitioners must also receive training in the use of lorazepam. Training manuals were sent to all con-ed sponsors in the region and a one hour lorazepam training module is now available. 
Lorazepam is just one example of an EMS medication that is affected by temperature extremes. Many EMS drugs lose their potency at high temperatures, especially in Pennsylvania’s climate where temper­atures can be exceedingly high in closed vehicles on hot days. Because of this, EMS services and practitioners should examine their current practices and follow these basic guidelines: 
• 
Park vehicles indoors when possible. When vehicles must be parked out­doors for extended times during hot weather, park in the shade. 

•
 If practitioners anticipate high tem­peratures in the drug storage com­partment of a vehicle, consider removing the drug bag when possible. If the drugs are removed, all policies related to security of the drugs still apply. This includes security require­ments for controlled substances. 

•
 Monitor compartment temperatures with a thermometer to develop a better understanding of drug storage tem­peratures. 

• 
Store drugs in temperature-controlled compartments on EMS vehicles, if available. These temperature con­trolled systems are available for EMS vehicles and installation should be considered for optimal temperature control. 


For more information on the storage of EMS drugs to prevent degradation due to heat, or the use of lorazepam in EMS vehicles, contact EMSI at (412) 242-7322. For more information on training programs on use of lorazepam, contact Bruce Sivak at EMSI, (412) 242-7322. 


Hepatitis C Remains Concern for EMS Responders


here has been an ongoing contro­versy over the years about whether or not EMS responders are at a higher risk of being infected by Hepatitis C than the general public. It has been speculated that responders are at greater risk because of their repeated exposure to victim’s blood. 
Two years ago, a report in the Philadelphia area showed that the infection rate among the city’s firefighters was more than three times the national average. But in­depth studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since that time have shown that pre-hospital providers do not show higher rates of Hepatitis C infection than the population at large. 

Don’t Forget the 04 

hen accessing the EMSI web site, don’t forget the 04. The web address is www.emsi04.org. Since EMSI is no longer affiliated with CAPA.net, the emsi4.org address is no longer valid. Using the 04 ensures you have access to the most up to date information on classes, conferences and other news from EMSI. 

A new twist to this ongoing debate are reports that indicated a serious risk to rescue workers involved in the World Trade Center rescue and excavation. These workers were exposed to body parts, blood and other substances that increased the risk of infection. 
In an effort to educate EMS personnel to the risks, symptoms and treatments for Hepatitis C and other infectious diseases, the United States Fire Administration (USFA), which is part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), has released a new Updated Emergency Services Infection Control Manual. The manual is designed to help guide emergency services in developing and improving their infection control programs. The document details the most comprehensive and updated infection control programs and practices for local level fire and emergency medical services departments. This includes information on Hepatitis C exposure. 
The manual is free and available in printed or downloadable format on the Internet. Quantities are limited.

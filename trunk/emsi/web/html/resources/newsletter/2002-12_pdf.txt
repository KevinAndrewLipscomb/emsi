Billie Jane Morris was recognized for her 40-plus years of service to EMS. She started her career in 1962 when she was hired as the manager of an ambu­lance service created by funeral direc­tors in Washington County. She was instrumental in sponsoring many inno­vative programs in the area: the first EMT training program to be certified by the PA Department of Health; one of the first paramedic training programs in the Commonwealth; the first Quick Response Services (QRS); and one of the first uses of AED’s in the state. At the annual meeting, Billie Jane enjoyed a surprise video of family members in Richmond and Italy congratulating her on receipt of the award. Jerry Esposito, after whom the award was named and last year’s recipient, presented the award to Billie Jane. He recalled how Billie Jane grew up through the ranks of EMS and affectionately called her one of “my girls” as he proudly told of the dedication she has given to the EMS field in this area over the years. 
More than 200 individuals attended the annual meeting and awards ceremony. At the meeting, Ed Heltman, president of the Ambulance Association of Pennsylvania (AAP), was the keynote speaker. He spoke about the various efforts of the AAP, including lobbying legislators for changes in reimbursements, building coalitions for increased funding for ambulance services, and researching recruitment and retention topics. He encouraged attendees to get involved with organizations like EMSI and AAP in order to speak as one voice about issues facing EMS.

For his efforts, he was honored by the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission. The EMSI Board of Directors commended him because, according to presenter Dr. Paul Paris, “He exemplified the spirit of the typical public safety official. Someone needed help and he was there to do what he could.”

riving an ambulance is a dangerous job as evidenced by the number of accidents that occur each year. Consider a study by Medical Priority Consultants in Salt Lake City, NV, that reveals that there are approximately 12,000 ambulance­related crashes every year in the United States. Of those, it is estimated there is about one fatality for every 100 crashes. 
While the Pennsylvania Department of Health does not require that a form be completed for every ambulance accident that occurs, it does strongly recommend that all accidents be reported. By keeping records, the Department can keep an eye on trends and problems in this vital area of EMS management. 
may be encountered.” This puts a great burden and responsibility on those who drive emergency vehicles every day. 
What can EMS providers do to reduce the likelihood of accidents? Providers should consider the following for the safety of the public and their EMS crews. 
• Consider buying rigsthat have a lower center of gravity to prevent the likelihood of rollover. Top heavy trucks tend to be more difficult to 

• When on the road, flash lights in anirregular pattern and in alternate colors, if possible. Use reflective tape to help other motorists discern vehicle shape, size and improve visibility. Use audible devices in a variety of different tones. All of these signals can help the public 
A recent article in 
Emergency Medical Services, the Journal of Emergency Care, Rescue and Transportation, notes that EMS providers are at a 50 percent greater risk of being involved in an accident while on duty compared with the average automobile driver. Some of these accidents are a result of other drivers not heeding warning devices by pulling to the right lane of traffic and stopping. Other acci­dents occur inside the ambulance itself due to loose items not being securely stored or crews being jostled about in the compartment during a rough ride. 
According to the article, while most states have traffic laws that allow special privileges for vehicles involved in an emergency response, it is the responsi­bility of the ambulance driver to ensure that the vehicle is operated in a safe and controlled manner. This includes keeping in mind the safety of others on the road, including motorists and pedestrians. Operators must drive with “due regard” for the safety of all persons, which means driving in a “safe manner considering all of the possibilities that corner at moderate speed. Size and weight considerations also play a role in stopping time. 
•
 Review the interior set up of theambulance and consider buying one that does not have cabinets above the bench seat, which can be hazardous to the crew. Also, place latching hardware in an easy to access location that is low in profile so that objects cannot fall out and strike the crew or patient. 

•
 Assess the set up of current rigs in useand store safely any unsecured equip­ment or supplies. Counter tops, crew benches or the floors of the ambulance should be free from clutter. Secure heavy items, such as oxygen cylinders, cardiac monitors, suction machines, drug bags and jump kits. Close and latch all doors and maintain stretcher mounting brackets adequately. Keep up to date on routine maintenance or repairs. 

• 
Educate ambulance drivers on accident prevention and safe driving. Consider programs that combine classroom and practical skills driving. 


respond appropriately when an EMS vehicle is approaching in an emergency. 
•
 Provide adequate educational oppor-tunities to the public to teach them what to do when they hear or see an ambulance approaching. Also, provide information on how to pass a stopped vehicle at the scene, as well as not parking or standing in fire lanes. 

•
 Be extra diligent in best conditions.A study in New York state concluded that the majority of accidents occurred during daylight hours, on straight and level roadways, in dry conditions, and during clear weather. While most ambulance operators would expect the numbers to be highest when drivers are tired or during bad weather conditions, it appears that in reality drivers may be more cautious during these times. A false sense of security in good conditions may lead to more accidents.

Medical Command Authorization Forms Due


he Pennsylvania Department of Health recently updated its Medical Command Authorization Form. Revised applications have been sent to all ambulance services and medical com­mand facilities in the region. This new form must be completed for all medical authorization requests for the 2003 calendar year. 
The new form was developed with input from regions and regional EMS medical directors. Changes and revisions in the form and reporting include the following: 
. The practitioner’s name, affiliate number, and calendar year are prominently labeled for quick reference. A separate Medical Command Authorization Form must be completed for each service with which an ALS practitioner desires medical command authorization. 
. There is no requirement for a Health Professional Physician to obtain medical command authori­zation, but ALS services or regions may want to use this form to identify all individuals within an ALS service that may be performing ALS treatment in the field. The form contains a check box to identify HP Physicians. 
. Each practitioner is required to identify all services that have granted the practitioner medical command authorization within the preceding five years. 
. Restrictions to medical command authorization have been split into two categories: restricted for pre­ceptoring and restricted for other reason. The restriction for precep­toring may only be used for the initial preceptoring with a service. Once an ALS practitioner has been granted unrestricted medical command authorization with a service, any additional restrictions must use the “restricted for other” reason option. 
. The Medical Command Authorization Form must be completed by the ALS practitioner and approved by the ALS service medical director before any practitioner may provide any care within the scope of practice of an ALS practitioner, unless the individual is a student in a recog­nized EMT-paramedic or PHRN class and is completing fieldwork under the auspices of the ALS training institute as a formal part of the training program. 
. The ALS practitioner now gives the ALS service and its medical director permission to investigate answers provided on the form and permits third parties to release information related to the individual’s professional competence to the ALS service medical director. 
. The simplified form only requires the name and signature of the ALS service medical director in one place when approving medical command authorization. 
. A page is available to complete if medical command authorization is denied, restricted, withdrawn, or requires completion of additional continuing education to address an identified deficiency in competence. In these cases, the ALS service medical director must document the reason(s) for such a decision. A copy of this page must be provided to the individual who sought medical command authorization. 
All completed Medical Command Authorization Forms must be received in the EMSI office by 4 p.m. on December 31, 2002 for calendar year 2003. To receive a copy of the form, contact EMSI at (412) 242-7322. 

Remember New Medical/Trauma Con-Ed Requirements 

s the new year approaches, all emergency medical service personnel are reminded of the following continuing education requirements for medical/ trauma categories: 
•
 EMTs must complete at least 12 CEU’s over three years in the Medical/Trauma category with an expiration date of January 1, 2004 or later. 

•
 First Responders must complete atleast 8 CEU’s over three years in the Medical/ Trauma category with an expi­ration date of January 1, 2004 or later. 



• Paramedics/HP’s must complete in each calendar year at least 
9 CEU’s in the Medical/Trauma category starting in 2002. 
Additional information 
on these changes and 
the scheduled con-ed 
classes is available on the Pennsylvania state web site at www.state.pa.us. 




Development of DNR Act in the Works 

he Pennsylvania Department of Health has issued a draft of amend­ments for Act 59, which is the Advance Directive for Health Care Act, and estab­lishment of the Do-Not-Resuscitate Act. Currently, agencies and stakeholders are commenting on the amendment draft; revisions are expected to be made and the Act implemented in the coming weeks. 
The amendments to the Advance Directive Act provide revised requirements for when emergency medical services (EMS) personnel are to implement a patient’s advance declaration directing that the patient not be resuscitated. The DNR Act establishes standards for and procedures by which a patient’s attending physician may provide a patient with an out-of-hospital do not resuscitate (DNR) order, bracelet or necklace that EMS personnel are to honor. 
Act 59 was signed into law on June 19, 2002, and went into effect on August 18, 2002. Implementation of Act 59 was to be completed by December 16, 2002 after public hearings were completed.

Learning More About Listeria

It can also be found in some came to the forefront in the past few raw foods, such as uncooked meats and months when an outbreak at a meat vegetables, as well as in processed plant in Philadelphia resulted in a foods that become contaminated after nationwide recall of meats. Listeria is a bacterial infection 
that occurs when people eat contaminated food. 
According to the Pennsylvania Department of Health, 20 cases of 
Listeria have been reported in Pennsylvania. Seven of those cases occurred in Philadelphia, with two deaths reported. Nationally, an esti­mated 2,500 people become seriously ill with Listeria each year. Reporting of Listeria cases became mandatory in Pennsylvania this year, so the numbers of reported cases will most likely increase in future years. 
For most people, Listeria is not dangerous. Those who are exposed may experience minor symptoms. However, pregnant women are at a higher risk of premature delivery or spreading the infection to their newborns, who 
can experience severe symptoms, processing, such as soft cheeses 
and cold cuts at the deli counter. Unpasteurized milk or foods made from unpasteurized milk also may contain the bacterium. 
Because it is easily transmitted in food, there are simple ways to prevent the spread of the bacteria. This includes washing and cooking food thoroughly; keeping uncooked food separate from cooked foods; and washing hands, knives and other food preparation items. 
Symptoms of Listeria can include fever, muscle aches and gastroin­testinal problems, such as nausea or diarrhea. If infection spreads to the 
nervous system, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or convulsions can occur. Symptoms can surface anywhere from a few days to more than two months after 
a person eats contaminated food. However, most people

Droperidol Removed from Pennsylvania ALS Units 

ollowing a change in the warning label for droperidol (Inapsine) by the drug manufacturer Akorn Pharmaceuticals, the Pennsylvania Department of Health has removed droperidol from the stock of medications to be carried on ALS units. The Department has recom­mended droperidol not be used in patient care until further notice and will most likely drop it from the state drug list. 
Droperidol has been a useful agent for sedation in the emergency department and prehospital setting and was added as an approved ALS drug for Pennsylvania EMS providers within the last year. However, recent research has shown that QT prolongation (delayed recharging of the heart between beats) within minutes after injection of a dose of droperidol at the upper end of the labeled dose range can result in a potentially fatal heart arrhythmia known as torsades de pointes. 
The new warning recommends a 12-lead ECG to identify QT prolon­gation before the use of droperidol. The ECG monitoring should be performed prior to treatment and continued for two to three hours after completing treatment to monitor for arrhythmias, according to the label warning. Because these patient care requirements are not feasible during EMS care, especially during the sedation of agitated out-of-hospital patients, the Pennsylvania Department of Health rec­ommended suspending use of droperidol by ALS services.

Droperidol continued from cover 
According to representatives from Akorn Pharmaceuticals, approximately five million units of droperidol are distributed annually. Of those, the FDA has reports of approximately 100 cases of cardiovascular adverse events and 18 deaths associated with the drug. There have been six deaths from torsades reported, with five of the adverse reactions occurring at or below the dose of 2.5 mg. 

Because of these statistics, Akorn Pharmaceuticals has changed the warning to state that droperidol should be reserved for use in the treatment of patients who fail to show an acceptable response to other adequate treatments, either because of insufficient effectiveness or the inability to achieve an effective dose due to intolerable adverse effects from those drugs. The recommendation continues to state that all patients should undergo a 12-lead ECG prior to administration of droperidol to determine if a prolonged QT 

interval (QTc greater than 440 msec for males or 450 msec for females) is present. If there is prolonged QT interval, the drug should not be administered. 
The Pennsylvania Department of Health EMS office suggests that patient protocols be updated to remove reference to the administration of droperidol, and that changes to regional treatment and transport protocols be reviewed and approved by the Department. This includes use of droperidol for the treatment of nau­sea since the risks associated with droperidol are not justified in the treatment of nausea in the prehospital setting. 
The Department of Health recommends ALS practitioners contact medical command for possible orders of a denzodiazepine as sedation for patients struggling against physical restraints. It will consider adding haloperidol or lorazepam to the ALS drug list as a substitute for droperidol. 
In addition to the removal of droperidol from the ALS drug list, there have been numerous drug shortages reported by the Department of Health over the past year. While these shortages are usually short term, the trend is expected to con­tinue in the coming years. 
ALS services can take several steps to ensure adequate stock in EMS vehicles, including: 
•
 Avoiding the temptation to overstock due to the shortage. Services should be able to project the amount of medications that will be needed to assure adequate stock without stockpiling additional medication that is likely to expire. 

•
 Establishing communications withsurrounding hospitals, pharmacies and medication suppliers to assure continued availability of stock. 

•
 Considering carrying substitutedrugs recommended by the Department of Health and estab­lished through regional treatment protocols. 


According to Douglas F. Kupas, Pennsylvania EMS Medical Director, there have been regular shortages of various generic medications over the last year. During these shortages, branded non-generic medications cannot keep up with the demand. Kupas agrees that these drug shortages are likely to continue and may affect almost every generic drug. 
The EMS office will continue to follow the shortages and suggest potential solutions for regions and EMS providers. 


Pilot Project Trains Rural EMTs on EpiPen Use 
course on epinephrine. During the course, lectures focused on allergies with an expanded pharmacology section on epinephrine, including handling and storage. EMTs engaged in a practice session with an instructor who was available to answer ques­

tions and critique per-EpiPen packets can help formance. The course those who are at a higher concluded with a risk for bee stings and practicum station where insect bites that can cause students were tested by a an allergic reaction. 

pilot project that began last August may offer a viable solution to pre­hospital units that may be called to treat individuals with acute allergic reactions. The EpiPen Pilot Project provides EMTs with epinephrine (EpiPen) auto-injectors and the necessary training to administer this life-saving drug to patients in rural areas where prolonged response time is an issue. 
The EpiPen Pilot Program began in August 2001 and focuses on providing EpiPen packets to EMTs in rural areas where hikers, campers and others are at a higher risk for bee stings and insect bites that can cause an allergic reaction. The EpiPen is a disposable drug delivery system with a spring-activated, concealed needle designed for emergency first aid to individuals sensitive to fatal allergic reactions. The needle injects epinephrine, which is the treatment of choice for anaphylactic reactions. 
The pilot project began in four rural areas: Bureau of State Parks at Ricketts Glen State Park, Fairmount Ambulance, Mildred Ambulance, and Sugarloaf Ambulance. These basic life support services received packets labeled with a face sheet about the project, contents, a warning and a contact number. Each packet contains two EpiPen adult and two EpiPen junior auto-injectors, a quick reference use card, index cards to record the content, and a document sheet to record and submit for event review. 
Twenty-five EMTs, along with personnel from the Columbia County Rescue Task Force, completed a four-hour training the observation that the required skill level had been achieved. I believe this is because the training rein­forced prior learned material building on a knowledge base and skills the EMTs already poss­essed.”
team consisting of a paramedic, nurse or physician observation tester and a patient tester. Using an anaphylaxis sce­nario, the patient tester interacted with the EMT while the observation tester recorded performance. 

The training proved to be successful with 22 of the 25 EMTs passing the training with a score of 86 percent or better and no critical misses on the first attempt. The final three passed upon immediate retesting. 
Follow-up with this initial group will be conducted every three months, including attendance at lectures, team meetings, and a visual check of the EpiPen packet contents. Retesting will occur every six months using the interactive patient anaphylactic scenario. 
“The training was easily assimilated by the EMTs,” notes Debra Stoner, MD, FACEP, EpiPen Project Coordinator. “Feedback from the four testers supported In the final analysis, Dr. Stoner believes that the project will have far reaching significance for services that want to have EMTs carry EpiPen in the field. 
“I believe equipping prehospital units with an epinephrine auto-injector has significant implications for improved patient outcomes in acute allergic reactions, especially in rural areas with prolonged response time,” notes Dr. Stoner. 
This can be safely achieved, according to Dr. Stoner, because: 
•
 EMTs have had prior training. 

•
 EMTs will be able to contact medical command for direction. 

•
 The use will be limited to EMTs who pass the additional training. 

•
 The medication, cases and outcomescan be monitored by standard DOH guidelines. 


The pilot project will continue through the summer of 2002. 


ANTHRA X 

ANTHRA X

Since the September 11 terrorist attacks, the word anthrax has become a household word. From reports of traces of anthrax in a senator’s office to the death of a postal worker from the disease, the mere mention of the word can bring anxiety to many individuals. While reports of actual cases of anthrax have been few, virtually every city in the United States has had to deal with an increase in the number of hoaxes and false reports of anthrax. Yet, the proper authorities, including EMS services that may be called to the scene, must address all threats. 
The following is a primer on diag­nosing and treating anthrax, as well as information on how to handle packages or other items that are suspected to contain anthrax spores. 
What is Anthrax? 
Anthrax is an infection caused by Bacillus anthracas, which is a spore­forming bacteria most often found in soil and in hoofed farm animals that have eaten food contaminated with the spores. Normally, humans who are at the highest risk for infection are those who work with farm animals or products, such as veterinarians or animal handlers. However, most cases of anthrax that occur naturally are found in south and central America, eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and the Middle East. Prior to September 2001, there were only 18 cases of inhalation anthrax reported in the United States in the last 100 years. The last case reported was in 1976. 

How Does Someone Become Infected? 
Infection occurs in three ways: through inhalation of air containing the spores; by touching contaminated animal fur, skin or anything else containing the spores; or by eating undercooked animal meat containing the spores. The most common natural occurrence is cutaneous anthrax, which occurs through direct contact with the skin. 
In the days since September 11, the bioterroristic threats have been associ­ated with inhalation anthrax in which individuals inhaled the spores con­tained in letters sent through the US Mail. While anthrax is not contagious, it can be deadly. 
What are the Symptoms of Inhalation Anthrax? 
The initial symptoms are similar to a cold, flu or pneumonia and may start with a cough, nausea and breathing problems. As the days progress, the symptoms worsen and eventually lead to a total collapse of bodily function. The majority of inhalation anthrax patients die within a day or two of the appear­ance of severe breathing difficulty. However, if antibiotic therapy (usually ciproflaxacin) begins early, patients can fully recover. 

Is There a Vaccine Against Anthrax? 
There is a vaccine; however, it is generally unavailable to general public. Currently, the vaccines are reserved for people who are at high risk, such as the military in areas where bioterrorism is a concern or individuals who work in laboratories where exposure is possible. In the days after September 2001, postal workers and others considered at a high risk for infection and possibly exposed to spores received the vaccine. 
The vaccine causes the body to produce anthrax fighting antibodies without actual exposure to the disease and is considered to be 93 percent effective in protecting against anthrax. The immunization involves three injections given two weeks apart followed by three additional injections given at six, 12 and 18 month intervals. There are not considered to be any long term side effects from the vaccine. 

The Center for Disease Control does not recommend a widespread use of the vaccination. Instead, it is only recom­mended for at-risk occupations and those individuals who have been identified to be at risk for exposure to the spores. 
How is Anthrax Being Used in Biological Warfare 
Because anthrax spores can survive for long periods, can be spread through the air, and cause severe fatal symptoms relatively quickly, it has become a real threat as a biological weapon. A treaty has been signed by 143 nations banning anthrax use in missiles or bombs. However, terrorists who obtain access to spores can spread the disease by spraying it, releasing it into ventilation systems, or even mailing it in packages or letters. In the most recent anthrax cases, the spores were in the form of a white powder mailed in envelopes to unsuspecting individuals. 
What Can People Do to Prevent Infection? 
If a suspicious letter or package appears and contains a threat or pow­dery substance, the person should put the package down immediately, cover it or put it in an envelope, and leave the area. The police should be called immediately. These officials may call the public safety department or the Department of Emergency Management and a hazardous materials team. Steps should be taken to be sure that no one goes near the potentially contaminated area. Anyone who touched the package should wash his or her hands and arms with warm soapy water. Also, heavily contaminated clothing should be removed, placed in a plastic bag, and given to emergency responders. The law enforcement officials will remove the package and bags, mostly likely while wearing gloves and masks, and send it for analyzation. While waiting for results, individuals who may have been exposed can take showers and wash their clothes in their own home, and do not need to be isolated since the disease is not contagious. If a person receives positive test results, he or she will be notified and antibiotic therapy can begin immediately. 
What is Being Done to Prepare for Additional Anthrax Threats? 
Local and regional officials have disaster plans that they follow regularly regarding bioterrorism and chemical warfare. These plans are being reviewed and updated to include response for anthrax and other chemical threats. 
Governor Richard Schweiker also announced at a recent meeting with the Pennsylvania Department of Health that the Commonwealth is planning roll-out of a process for how to handle this type of threat at the state level. This roll-out is expected within the next two months. 
“The State Health Laboratory in Chester County is currently the only facility in the state that is designated by the FBI and the Centers for Disease Control as a reference lab for chemical and bio­terrorism testing. It has performed all of the state’s anthrax testing,” noted Schweiker in a recent press release. He added that the Health Department is “working with health officials in the Pittsburgh area to improve public health laboratory capacity in Allegheny County – not just for western Pennsylvania, but also as a backup bio-terrorism lab­oratory for the entire state.” 
In addition to activities at the local and state level, the federal government has supplies of antibiotics and antidotes for biological and chemical warfare. These supplies are centrally located and can be delivered within hours of the identification of exposure. Individuals are discouraged from stockpiling antibiotics for future use should an exposure occur and should not take such antibiotics unless recommended by a physician.

t’s a well known fact that there is a staffing shortage in the emergency medical services field. The Emergency Medical Services Institute recently con­ducted a survey of ambulance services in the region to validate this claim. 

Last year, all 176 ambu­lance companies in the region received a survey that asked for specific numbers of paramedics and EMTs on staff. The survey also asked for numbers of open positions. Of the 55 ambulance companies that respond­ed, it was reported that there were 195 para-

There are 71 full time and 109 part time EMT openings in the same companies. 
The reasons for shortages are numerous and as varied as the people represented in the field. Some qualified personnel accept positions in hospitals or with other health care providers that are also suffering from shortages. Others attribute the move out of the EMS setting to low wages. Whatever the reasons, there is a very real issue in the field today as ambulance companies struggle to recruit and retain qualified personnel. 
“The staffing issues so prevalent in health care have spread to the prehospital environment,” notes Phil Stoner, EMSI executive director. “They are significantly affecting the services on which the citizens of the Commonwealth depend.”

EMSI Offers Information on the Voluntary Rescue Service Recognition Program 

ast year, the Department of Health and the Pennsylvania Health Services
Council (PEHSC) announced the imple
­mentation of the Voluntary Rescue
Service Recognition program designed
to provide rescue services with standards
for training and equipment.

Rescue services wishing to participate
in this program must be recognized in
one of three categories: first responder,
operations or advanced. With each step up
in category, the requirements for staffing
and equipment increase to a higher
level of ability in rescue capability.

EMSI can provide rescue services with a copy of the Voluntary Rescue Service Recognition document. To request a copy, the chief or director of the rescue team must send a letter on business letterhead to EMSI. If the service meets all the requirements of the program, an appli­cation can be completed and returned with the necessary documentation to EMSI. 
Upon receipt of the application, the fol­lowing EMSI field representatives will arrange an inspection of the rescue service based on locale.

Purpose of Evaluation Book 
This book has been prepared for evaluators and lead evaluators to use during PA DOH State EMT/FR Practical Examinations. The book has been created to provide an evaluator with the essential information needed to assess the knowledge and skill abilities of students that are being tested. 
This book has been “standardized” to provide the essential testing information.  Regional councils may wish to include additional information concerning specific regional council evaluator guidelines.  The core content has been created to allow evaluators to do their job, observe a student’s ability and not complete a lot of paperwork. 
An evaluator need only concentrate on three area of documentation: 
1. 
Student Rotation Form 

2. 
Student Log In Sheet 

3. 
Scenario Evaluation Form 


General Information 
Evaluators will need to complete a scenario evaluation form for each group of students being tested. The student log-in sheet should be filled out and left in the book until the end of the examination. The lead evaluator to verify students completed a specific station uses this form.  Students carry the student rotational form to each station. The evaluator is to initial the form.  A student must have all three evaluator initials to have a valid rotational form.  The rotational form is turned into the lead evaluator at the end of their last station.  The lead evaluator validates the evaluator’s initials on the rotational form and collects the student(s) evaluation forms from those evaluators. 
Using a scoring template, the lead evaluator will score each of the student evaluation forms. The lead evaluator will then advise students of their status. 
At the conclusion of the examination, the evaluator should return this evaluation book to the lead evaluator. 
Don’t forget to Sign In and Sign Out on the evaluator sign in form. 
Logistics Manual 
The Examination Format 
Examination Format Overview: 
The practical examination is comprised of three separate stations, known as patient care stations (PC).  
PC 1 (Basic Life Support) Station 
PC 2 (Trauma) Station 
PC 3 (Medical Emergency) Station 
Individual students are asked to partner with another candidate to form a team of two.  If odd numbers of candidates exist, after everyone in the test has been partnered, the lone candidate will proceed through the examination stations by being partnered with another student who already completed their examination. It is not acceptable to have a team of three or four candidates test.  
The examination candidates are provided with a tracking number and are to record the number onto their rotation form. The exam candidates proceed to stations and wait for a station to open.  At each station the station evaluator initials the candidate’s rotational form, as a validation of completion for that station; it has no inference on the candidates examination score.  Upon the completion of the three stations within their bank, the candidates return to the briefing area for a status report regarding their examination performance.  Whenever possible, students should be informed of their examination status, by the examination coordinator, prior to leaving the practical examination. 
Station Specifics: 
Each of the PC stations is formatted to meet specific educational objectives.  This section identifies the specific station logistics related to setup, personnel, equipment, and the overall management of the evaluation station. 
Logistics Manual 
PC1 Basic Life Support (BLS) 
This station assesses individual basic life support skills and a team’s adult cardiac arrest management skills.  Using Department of Health approved scenarios; the station evaluator briefs the team of two (2) examination candidates directly outside the testing area.  The first testing component is cardiac arrest management.  The station evaluator states, “following the completion of the cardiac arrest management scenario, each of you will “individually” complete a separate BLS skill scenario. Upon the conclusion of the cardiac arrest scenario, each candidate will perform a separate/random BLS skill, i.e. adult foreign body airway obstruction, infant CPR, etc. ”. Individual skill assessment sheets are used to assess the random skills. 
Individual skills testing can be done prior to the team Cardiac Arrest Management.  If the team is done first, it is suggested that we cover up (with a sheet) the other manikin/equipment for the individual skills, so as not to confuse the students. 
Station Time: Cardiac Arrest Management   10 Minutes for each team 
  Individual Skill Scenario  5 Minutes for each candidate  
  Maximum Station Time   20 Minutes  
Station Equipment: -In working order:  
- Live or Placebo AED  

-AED defibrillation compatible manikin (live AED) Torso or Full Body CPR Manikin (placebo AED) 
- Adult Intubation Manikin or airway compatible manikin 
-Child CPR Manikin (Skill Dependent) 
-Infant CPR Manikin (Skill Dependent) 
-
 Complete O2 System (key, BVM, Airways, Adjuncts, Full Bottle) Oxygen tank and regulator assembled. 

-
 Complete Patient Assessment Kit (DOH Accreditation 


Equipment List) -Suction Unit (DOH Accreditation Equipment List) 
-Blankets 
-Long spine board or other lifting & moving device 
Personnel: (1) Live Patient Actor (Scenario Specific) 
(1) State Evaluator 
Evaluation Supplies: - Appropriate Realism Props For Scenario 
-Evaluation Scenario & Documentation Materials 
If the student candidates, on a live patient actor measure an airway, allow the candidate to measure the airway, but tell them to lay it aside, rather than insert it. Cardiac Arrest Management: Logistics Manual 
The crew will assess a conscious or unconscious “live” patient actor or a manikin, (scenario dependent). The candidates will respond as a transporting team of two persons. The student team is to carry the patient care equipment they feel they need in order to handle the station. At a pre-determined point in the scenario, the patient actor will become unconscious and / or cease breathing.  At this point, the treatment activities are to be move from the “live” patient actor to the pre-setup CPR manikins. For the conscious patient, the patient actor will be moved to the floor prior to switching to the manikin.  The live patient actor will be excused from the testing area. At a pre-determined point, the patient actor may be again assessed once the AED has been used on the manikin; this action will be scenario dependent. 
At the conclusion* of the cardiac arrest management scenario, each candidate will complete a separate BLS management skill.  Using two different scenarios, each testing candidate will complete the management of the skill without the assistance of their partner.  The station concludes when each candidate completes the individual skill management scenario. Both candidates remain in the testing station during the individual testing. 
*The cardiac arrest management can be done before or after the individual skills. 
Logistics Manual 
PC 2 Trauma: 
A team of two candidates will respond to a single person, non-transporting unit.  At this station, the candidates are to identify, assess, treat, and immobilize the live patient actor. A “bystander” may be available as dictated by the scenario. This bystander will interact with the crew only if asked questions.  The information will be specific and identified within the station scenario.  The bystander may also assist with certain treatment procedures, (i.e. holding the patient’s cervical spine, supporting the backboard, assisting with a logroll procedure, holding an injured extremity). The by-stander will NOT offer any medical or treatment advice. If a bystander is present and asked to assist, he or she should respond: “Tell me or show me how.”

Logistics Manual 
Examination Setup: 
The practical examination area should be large enough to contain (1) briefing room and enough additional rooms for the station areas.  The briefing room should contain enough tables and chairs for the initial group of candidates being evaluated.  The briefing room is used for the initial briefing of the candidates, a holding area for candidates waiting for the examination, and a debriefing area for candidates completing the examination. 
A testing facility often determines the composition of the examination setup.  Large testing rooms can be used if barriers between the stations can be erected.   Candidates being tested in large testing areas, who are waiting to be tested, need to be positioned between stations in a “neutral area”, which they are not able to observe other students taking their examinations.  
All examination areas are to be designated as non-smoking areas.  Rest room facilities should be available to the examination candidates during the examination.  The testing facility will dictate the exact examination setup. 
Examination candidates should be instructed to arrive 15 minutes prior to the announced starting time for the examination.  Upon entering the briefing area, the candidate should be instructed to pick-up, read and / or sign the following forms: 
1.
 Risk Agreement Form 

2.
 Rotational Form 


The examination coordinator will then “brief” the candidates regarding the practical examination: 
1.	
Assign the examination candidates partners.  Teams of two (2) are to be formed.   If odd numbers of candidates exist following the creation of the two person teams, the single candidate will be partnered with a student that has already completed the station/test.  

2.	
A roll call of the eligible testing candidates is conducted.  Only pre-registered, pre-authorize candidates will be allowed to test.  The examination coordinator should review the course files prior to the start of the examination to determine the eligibility of the candidates.  For challenge students, photo identification or other identification should be checked prior to assigning the candidates to a bank of stations. 

Logistics Manual 

3.	
Using the examination overview, review the examination process with the examination candidates. Specifically identify the pass/fail criteria, retest   options, time, written exam date and time, rotational form, and the completion of the risk agreement form.  Each candidate needs to be aware that leaving the examination without authorization by the examination coordinator warrants an immediate failure for the test.  Each candidate will receive notification of his or her examination performance from the examination coordinator. 

4.	
Optional: Assign each examination candidate a tracking number assignment.  When the station areas are completely filled with registered candidates, the examination coordinator should have the candidates proceed to their assigned areas. The remaining exam candidates will then be assigned their tracking numbers and station assignments. 

NOTE: This selection process is best done at random, unless certain students indicate work-related excuses to complete the examination in the first round. 

5.	
The remaining candidates not immediately going to the stations are to remain in the briefing area.  Optional:  The examination coordinator will call the remaining candidates by their tracking numbers.  This is done for each assigned station area, thus candidates with the next tracking numbers will likely be called to stand outside the testing stations in a relatively short period of time. 


As the examination coordinator briefs the candidates, the evaluators should be locating their stations, briefing their patient actors and by-standers, and preparing the station area for the start of the examination.  Patient actor’s moulage should match the station scenario. Any additional realism props should be positioned around the patient actor prior to the candidates entering the testing area.  A baseline set of the actual patient actor’s vital signs is to be taken in the medical station by the station evaluator and documented on the station log sheet. 
Logistics Manual 
Notification of Scores and Candidate Questionnaire: 
Upon completion of the three stations in their station assignment, the exam candidates are to return to the briefing area.  They are to bring their rotational forms to the exam coordinator.  The exam coordinator is to attain the evaluation forms from the evaluators. As individual teams, the exam coordinator should privately advise each of the teams of candidates of their individual status.  Feedback will be provided to each group of students concerning their examination performance. For candidates needing a retest, the date, time, and location of the retest should be identified.  Candidates should complete a Candidate Questionnaire form prior to their being notified of their examination results.

Logistics Manual 
Specific Evaluation Critical Areas: 
1. 
AED: 

During the cardiac arrest management scenario, the team is to follow the PA DOH AED protocol to use the AED unit on the simulated cardiac arrest victim.  The team’s ability to use the protocol to effectively deliver the appropriate number and order of defibrillation is a critical evaluation element.  Assuring the scene safety and candidate safety when using a placebo or live AED is not only an evaluation element, but is a station evaluation element. 

2.
 Oxygen Administration: 


Individual candidates will use supplemental O2 delivery devices and adjuncts to treat patients in all three testing stations.  Knowing when to apply, how to apply, and what devices to apply are assessed in each of the station areas.  
Once a candidate applies and turns on the O2 device (i.e. non-rebreather mask), the evaluator may remove the oxygen mask and turn off the O2 cylinder.    
3.
 Trauma Management: 

The station scenarios will contain either a patient who is a “load & go” or will be a “stay & treat” trauma patient.  The crew’s ability to make an appropriate decision between the two types of patients is a critical evaluation element. Additionally, the crew’s ability to assess, treat life threatening situations, adequately immobilize the patient are other critical evaluation elements. 

4.
 Medical Emergency Management: 

The medical emergency station is designed to assess each individual candidate’s prehospital management skills. Individual performance and management of a medical emergency patient is assessed in this station area.  Patient communication skills, patient assessment, initial treatment interventions, and an oral report of pertinent patient findings to a medical command physician, a receiving facility, or a responding transporting unit (BLS or ALS) are the critical evaluation elements for this station. 

5. 
Vital Sign Assessment: 


Accurate vital sign assessment is a critical testing element at all stations.  Each candidate at the medical emergency station will accurately assess the vital signs of the patient actor and report their findings to the medical direction facility.  Vital signs shall be within the following percentages or variances: 10% for BP: systolic and diastolic; 10% for and Pulse and 25% for respirations. 
Logistics Manual 
6. Radio Report: 
Communicating accurate patient information to healthcare providers is essential.  At the medical emergency station, each candidate will provide a precise, accurate, and professional oral radio report to a medical command physician, a medical facility or a responding BLS or ALS transporting unit.  The content of the radio report shall contain: 
-Patient chief complaint 
-Approximate age, sex, weight of the patient 
-Pertinent patient assessment findings 
-Vital sign assessment 
-Treatments

Optional: Bank/Station Determination: 
NOTE: A regional council may decide upon a coordination system that works for their system. The system described below is provided as an example. 
Determination of the number of banks/stations is proportional to the number of candidates being tested. The following chart estimates the number of banks/stations required for specific numbers of candidates: Strongly Recommended: 
Number of Candidates
 < 16 
 16 - 36 
 36 - 54 
 54+ (Not Staggered) 
54+ (Staggered @ 1.5 Hr. Intervals) 

  No. Scenarios Required     3 stations      6 stations      9 stations    12 stations 9 stations 
Staggering groups of candidates can allow an examination to be conducted with fewer banks.  A minimum of 1.5 hours between groups should be allowed.  This provides sufficient time for the registration and briefing of the new group, plus allows the first group of candidates to finish their station areas. Care should be given to ensuring that adequate staff is available to assist the lead evaluator/test coordinator with administrative and logistic duties at large volume examinations. This will ensure that the practical examination will run in a smooth and timely manner. 
Logistics Manual 
Examination Scheduling: 
The regional EMS council and the training institutes cooperatively establish the state testing dates and times for the certification examinations.  Efforts to consolidate the state testing between training programs at various training sites should be made to minimize the costs and maximize the logistics of the examinations. 
For example, if one training site, with 26 students, is completing their training program two weeks ahead of another training site in the same county/area, with 22 students, efforts to consolidate the classes into a single examination site should be pursued. Cost, logistics, staff time, evaluator utilization, and facility utilization are factors that need to be considered when scheduling examinations 
Tracking Examination Candidates: 
Upon entering the examination briefing room, each examination candidate is to complete a student rotation form. This form is to be taken to each examination station area and is to be initialed by the station evaluator.  The rotational form is used to verify the attendance at all three of the examination stations within a bank.  The rotation form is turned into the examination coordinator upon completion of all three examination stations. 
Each rotational form may contain a tracking number for the exam candidate.  This tracking number corresponds to a tracking number on the examination coordinator’s master form.  The tracking identification number enables the examination coordinator to “track” the examination candidate through the examination. The tracking number is also contained on the station evaluator’s scoring form. When the examination coordinator collects the station check sheets, they can easily match the scores for the candidate on the different forms. 
Examination Flow: 
The examination coordinator, with assistance from the local training institute personnel, need to assure that the examination stations have an ample supply of candidates to be tested at each station area.  The examination coordinator needs to closely monitor the “flow” of the exam and insert the new examination candidates before a station area is to open. 
Logistics Manual 
Throughout the Exam: 
The examination coordinator or assistant rotates through the station areas collecting the evaluation forms from the station evaluators.  
The exam coordinator will go through each station to observe exam candidates and/or evaluator performance on the examination. Any major discrepancies or concerns must be made known to the regional council immediately.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT AND ASSUMPTION OF RISK AGREEMENT 
The Pennsylvania EMT (Emergency Medical Technician) certification examination is made up of two parts -- a written portion and a practical portion.  This is the practical portion, which consists of three stations where your ability to perform specific skills will be assessed.  You will be given hypothetical and contrived situations in which your ability to treat a simulated victim will be evaluated. 
There are three (3) stations.  Stations are called “Patient Care Stations” (PC) and are numbered 1, 2, and 3. 
PC 1 Station consists of two components.  The first component deals with your ability to cooperatively (with a partner) treat and manage a cardiac arrest situation.  The second component assesses your ability to perform individual basic life support skills (i.e. oral airway insertion, infant CPR) The PC 2 Station deals with your ability to cooperatively (with a partner) treat and manage a trauma victim.  The PC 3 Station deals with your ability to individually treat and manage a medical emergency patient. 
At PC 1 and PC2 stations, a maximum of 20 minutes has been allotted.  For PC 3, a maximum of 12 minutes has been allotted.  All treatments are to be completed within these time frames. 
You may take a blank piece of paper or tape into the station with you to write on after you have entered the station. 
Successful completion of the examination is based on attaining all satisfactory scores in each testing station. A Satisfactory score indicates that a candidate was able to identify the problem or task presented. The student has demonstrated appropriate treatment and performed correct skills that meet the objectives being assessed.  An Unsatisfactory score indicates that the candidate was unable to demonstrate appropriate treatment or skills, based on the objectives being assessed. The candidate performed skills that would adversely affect patient outcome.  In order to be eligible for the written examination, you successfully complete the practical examination. 
Students who attain unsatisfactory scores are eligible for a retest of the station/skill areas. The following chart identifies retest criteria: Logistics Manual 
Unsatisfactory Score (By Candidate)  Action Required For Retest  
Trauma Station   Retest Trauma Station  
Medical Station  Retest Medical Station  
BLS Station: Cardiac Arrest Mgt.   Retest Cardiac Arrest Management Station  
Individual BLS Skill   Retest Individual Skill  

Upon completion of all your stations, you will be notified regarding your performance during the examination.  Each student will receive feedback regarding his or her performance during the examination.  Questions or concerns regarding the practical examination should be directed to the regional EMS council that administered the practical examination. 
The PC station scenarios have been developed to simulate realistic settings.  Once in a testing area, the evaluator is not to answer questions about the setting.  The evaluator’s interaction shall be limited to providing placebo vital signs (if indicated) and/or patient specific information. The evaluator will be your dispatcher for all stations At the BLS (PC1) and Medical Emergency (PC3) stations; the evaluator will act as the Medical Command Physician, if one is required.  The evaluator will only recognize and react to information provided by the candidate’s in their oral report. 
Relax! Take some deep breaths just before you enter your stations.  While you wait, think about how you would react to various patient treatment situations.  Visualize yourself performing a skill, (e.g. AED application, medical patient assessment).  Review the treatment protocols that are used to assist a patient self-administer their medications or to use the AED unit. 
Tobacco usage during the state certification briefing and testing is prohibited.  Check with the local testing center as to what areas you are permitted to smoke. 
The undersigned assumes all responsibility for all risk of damage or injury that may occur to the undersigned while attending or participating in a practical examination.  In consideration of being accepted as a participant in such practical examinations, the undersigned hereby releases, discharges, and holds harmless the emergency medical services council and any associated organizations and successors and their owners, employees, and agents from all claims, demands, rights of causes of action, present and future, whether known, anticipated or unanticipated, and resulting from or arising out of, or incident to, the undersigned’s attendance at, participation in or intended participation in practical examinations.

Practical Examination Ethics 
The “Realistic EMT-B Practical Examination” has been developed to create a realistic test-taking environment.  Efforts have been made to minimize evaluator, patient actor, and student bias. If during the completion of this examination, you (as a student, patient actor, or evaluator) encounter a situation in which you feel you may not receive/render/or have unfair influence over an evaluation, you are to immediately contact the examination coordinator. 
Ideally, an evaluator from the same EMS agency should not evaluate students from the same service. Evaluators must not have instructed in the course areas that they are evaluating. Evaluator shall be selected from out-of-county, whenever possible.  The evaluator shall not have a family relationship with any student being evaluated.

Recommendations for improvement: __________________________________ 

Good [morning, afternoon, evening]. My name is [Examination Coordinator/Lead Evaluator]. I will be the Examination Coordinator/Lead Evaluator administering this examination. On behalf of the Pennsylvania Department of Health Emergency Medical Services Office, the [regional EMS Council hosting], and [Name of Sponsoring Institution], I would like to welcome you here today.  We extend our sincere wishes for your successful completion of this examination process and obtaining subsequent Pennsylvania certification. 
I will now read the roster to confirm attendance before we begin the orientation.  Please identify yourself when I call your name so that I may record your attendance on the official roster. 

If I did not call your name, please identify yourself so that I can record your attendance today.   
The instructions I am about to give pertain to the practical examination.  Please pay close attention, as these instructions will not be repeated at a later time. 
The Scenario Evaluators utilized today were selected because of their expertise in the assigned skill.  The Scenario Evaluator is an observer and recorder of your actions. Each Scenario Evaluator documents your performance in relationship to criteria established by the Pennsylvania Department of Health Emergency Medical Services Office (EMS Office) that adheres to the National Standard Training Curricula. 
The Scenario Evaluator will call you into the skill when it is prepared for testing.  No candidate, at any time, is permitted to remain in the testing area while waiting for his/her next station. You must wait outside of the room until the station is opened and you are called. 
 You are not permitted to take any books, pamphlets, brochures, study materials, or any other electronic or mechanical devices.  At this time, all pagers, cellular telephones, personal digital assistants, and similar electronic communication devices must be turned off. If you attempt to use any of these devices during the examination for any reason whatsoever, you will be immediately dismissed from the remainder of the examination, including the written examination if you have not yet completed it. 
As you enter the room, the Scenario Evaluator will greet you and ask for your first and last name. Please provide the proper spelling of your name so that your results may be reported accurately. The Scenario Evaluator will then read aloud the Scenario Dispatch Information exactly as printed on the scenario sheet provided by the EMS Office. This information is read to each of you in the same manner to ensure consistency and fairness. Please pay close attention to the information as they correspond to similar information you might receive on an EMS call and give you valuable information on what will be expected of you during your performance.  The Scenario Evaluator will ask if you understand the instructions and will be happy to repeat any portion if necessary.  Do not ask the Scenario Evaluator to supply additional information not contained in the instructions, as this is not permitted. 
The stations are supplied with several types of equipment for your selection.  You will be given time at the beginning of each station to survey and select the equipment necessary for the appropriate management of the patient.  Do not feel obligated to use all of the equipment. The Scenario Evaluator will offer to point out any specific operational features of the equipment if you are unfamiliar with any device. If you brought any of your own equipment, it must be inspected and approved by the Examination Coordinator/Lead Evaluator before you enter the skill. 
As you progress through the practical examination, each Scenario Evaluator will be observing and documenting your performance.  Do not let their documentation practices influence your performance. There is no correlation between the volume of their documentation and the quality of your performance.  You are encouraged to explain the things you are doing within the scope of the time limit.  The Scenario Evaluator may also ask questions for clarification purposes only.  Simply answer any questions and do not assume they are meant to provide feedback on the quality of your performance. 
If the skill has an overall time limit, the examiner will inform you of this during the instructions. However, if you complete the skill before your allotted time, inform the Skill Examiner that you have finished your performance.  You may be asked to Candidates sometimes complain that Scenario Evaluators are abrupt, cold, or appear unfriendly. No one is here to add to the stress and anxiety you already feel.  It is important for you to understand that the Scenario Evaluators have been instructed to avoid any casual conversation with you.  This is necessary to ensure fair and equal treatment of all candidates throughout the exam.  Please recognize this behavior as professional and simply perform the skills to the best of your ability. We have instructed the Scenario Evaluators not to indicate to you in any way your performance in any skill.  Do not interpret any remarks as an indication of your overall performance. 
You are not permitted to discuss any specific details of any scenario with each other at any time.  Please be courteous to the candidates who are testing by keeping all excess noise to a minimum.  Be prompt in reporting to each station so that we may complete this examination within a reasonable time period. 
There are four scoring areas. Two of the areas are team scored and two are individually scored. To pass the examination, the candidate must attain satisfactory scores at each station. If you attain an unsatisfactory score (s), you will be eligible for retesting under the EMS Office’s retesting policy. 
The purpose of certification by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is to verify achievement of minimal competencies for safe and effective practice after the educational component has been completed.  All candidates will be informed of their scores. In addition to Pass/Fail status, the Examination Coordinator/Lead Evaluator will provide information regarding your performance at the examination stations. This information is for your benefit and is NOT subject to discussion or debate, it is merely a method by which you can focus your remediation to better prepare you for a retest opportunity. Please remember that today's examination is a formal verification process. The Skill Examiners have not played any role in the establishment of pass/fail criteria, but merely observe and document your performance in each skill.  
If you feel you have a complaint concerning the practical examination, a formal complaint procedure does exist.  You may initiate any complaint with the Examination Coordinator/Lead Evaluator today or submit a written complaint to your regional EMS council or the EMS Office. 
If you feel that you have been discriminated against, you should contact the Examination Coordinator/Lead Evaluator immediately to initiate the complaint process. 
We are here today to ensure that fair, objective, and impartial evaluations occur in accordance with EMS Office policy.  If you have any concerns, notify the Examination Coordinator/Lead Evaluator immediately to discuss your concerns.  I will be visiting all skills throughout the examination to verify adherence to these guidelines. 
Does anyone have any questions concerning the practical examination at this time? 
Scenario Evaluators Orientation to the Practical Examination 

Good [morning, afternoon, evening]. My name is [Coordinators name].  I will be the Examination Coordinator administering this examination. On behalf of the Pennsylvania Department of Health EMS Office, [regional EMS Council hosting] and [Name of Hosting Institution], I would like to thank you for serving as a Scenario Evaluator today.  All data relative to a candidate's performance is based upon your objective recordings and observations.  You were chosen as an Scenario Evaluator today because of your expertise in the assigned skill and ability to fairly and accurately observe and document various performances.  All performances must be reported with the greatest degree of objectivity possible.  The forms you are using today have been designed to assist you in objectively evaluating the candidates. 
Let me emphasize that this examination is a formal verification procedure not designed for teaching, coaching, or remedial training.  Therefore, you are not permitted to give any indication whatsoever of satisfactory or unsatisfactory performance to any candidate at any time.  You must not discuss any specific performance with anyone other than the lead evaluator or myself.  If you are unsure of scoring a particular performance, notify me as soon as possible.  Do not sign or complete any evaluation form in which you have a question until we have discussed the performance. If I'm busy with other duties, make notes of the performance and continue on with your evaluation of other candidates if possible, as soon as possible, get the coordinators attention and address the issue. 
You must act in a professional manner at all times, paying particular attention to the manner in which you address candidates.  The Pennsylvania Department of Health does not discriminate or harass and it will not tolerate any type of discrimination or harassment by anyone involved with administration of the practical examination. You must be consistent, fair, and respectful in carrying out your duties as a formal Scenario Evaluator. The safest approach is to limit your dialogue to examination-related material only.  Be careful of the manner in which you address candidates, as many will interpret your remarks as some indication of their performance. 
We suggest you introduce yourself to each candidate as you call them into your room. No candidate, at any time, is permitted to remain in the testing area while waiting for his/her next station.  As the candidate enters, be sure they did not bring any books, pamphlets, brochures, study materials, calipers, calculators, or any other electronic or mechanical devices.  Take a few moments and clearly print the candidate’s first and last name on the evaluation form as well as your name, the date, and scenario or set number if required.  We suggest you use ink pens and follow good documentation practices when completing these forms.  You should then read aloud the scenario dispatch information exactly as printed on the scenario outline for your particular station. You may not add to or detract from these instructions but you may repeat any portion as requested.  The instructions must be read to each candidate in the same manner to ensure consistency and fairness.  Give the candidate time to inspect the equipment if necessary and explain any specific design features of the equipment if you are asked.  If the candidate enters with any equipment, be sure the lead evaluator or myself have inspected it and you are familiar with its use prior to evaluating the candidate. 
When the candidate begins their performance, document the time started on the evaluation form if required.  As the candidate progresses through the skill, fill out the evaluation form in the following manner: 
1. 
Place a check in the appropriate space at the time each item is completed. 

2. 
Leave the box blank for any step that was not completed or was performed in an unacceptable fashion (inappropriate, haphazard, in excessive and potentially detrimental delay). 


All forms should be filled-out in a manner that prohibits the candidate from directly observing any scoring or comments you may note.  Do not become distracted by searching for specific statements on the evaluation form when you should be observing the candidate's performance. Ideally, you should be familiar with these forms, but if this occurs, simply turn the form over and concisely record the entire performance on the backside.   After the candidate finishes the performance, complete the front side of the evaluation form in accordance with the documented performance.   
Please remember the most accurate method of fairly evaluating any candidate is one in which your attention is devoted entirely to the performance of the candidate. 
You must observe and enforce all time limits for the scenarios.  When the time limit has been reached, simply stop the candidate's performance promptly, document the time the performance ended, and direct the candidate to move on to the next station, making sure that no candidate takes any notes or recording of the scenario (notes on vital signs, scenario information, etc.). 
You are responsible for the security of all evaluation materials throughout the examination and must return all materials to me before you leave this site.  If you need to take a break, inform the Examination Coordinator or me and secure all evaluation instruments that were issued to you.  After you receive your materials, proceed to your station and check the props, equipment, and moulage to ensure all equipment is available and functioning properly.  You should orient any Simulated Patients and EMT Assistants to their roles today.  The Simulated Patients should act as a similar patient would in a field situation and the bystanders should perform as an untrained bystander would, performing only those tasks requested by the testing candidate(s). Please emphasize the importance of their consistent and professional performance throughout today's examination.  You must read through your material and instructions, brief your Bystanders and Simulated Patients, and review the evaluation form prior to evaluating any candidate.  Please wait until I have inspected your room and answered any of your specific questions before opening your skill. I will also be visiting all skills during the examination and will try to avoid interference as much as possible. 
Are there any questions before we dismiss?

Pupils ____________ 1. Check both pupilsby observing for size (dilated, constricted, normal). ____________ 1. Check both pupils for equality (equal or unequal). ____________ 1. Check both pupils for reactivity (fixed, reactive, sluggish). ____________ 1. Check pupil reaction to light.  As appropriate, either expose to or shade from light on 
the pupil to check for reaction. ____________ 2. Repeat step (1) for other eye.  Compare to the first. ____________ 3. Record observations. 
Diagnostic/ Vital Signs Procedures (Continued) Blood Pressure Take patient’s blood pressure using a sphygmomanometer, by either auscultation or palpation method. 
(The palpation method should be used when one cannot hear the pulse sounds due to the background noise levels) Auscultation ____________ 1. Expose the arm and position blood pressure cuff above the elbow, centering bladder 
over the brachial artery. 
____________ 2. Palpate brachial pulse at the crease of elbow, place diaphragm of stethoscope at that point. 
____________ 3. Inflate cuff until mercury column or needle of dial stops moving with the pulse; increase pressure by 20-30mmHg so as not to miss the first systolic pulse sound. 
____________ 4. Release air slowly from the cuff; observe mercury column fall or aneroid dial return to zero. 
____________ 5. Record as the systolic pressure the point on the gauge at which the sound of the first pulse is heard. 
____________ 6. Record as the diastolic pressure the point on the gauge at which the sound disappears or distinctly changes to a very dull sound. 
____________ 7. Blood pressure is recorded as Systolic/Diastolic, i.e., “130/80” 
Palpation 
____________ 1. Palpate the radial pulse point on the arm to which the cuff has been applied. (Maintain pulse point contact.) 
____________ 2. Inflate the cuff as explained under auscultation, which is to increase pressure by 20­
30mmHg after the radial pulse is no longer palpated.  
____________ 3. Deflate the cuff slowly while continuing to palpate the radial pulse point. 
____________ 4. When the pulse is felt, observe gauge. 
____________ 5. Record, as the systolic pressure, the point on the gauge at which the pulse is first felt.  
Record as Systolic by palpation or “130/p”. 
Diagnostic/ Vital Signs Procedures (Continued) 
Vital Sign Reassessment 
Patient vital signs should be taken and recorded according to the following guidelines: 
____________ 1. Every 15 minutes, at minimum, for a stable patient. 
____________ 2. Every 5 minutes, at minimum, for an unstable patient. 
____________ 3. Following all medical interventions and then either every 5 or 15 minutes depending on patient condition. 
CRITICAL CRITERIA ______ Uses appropriate BSI (body substance isolation) precautions ______ Vital signs assessed within the following percentages or variances: 10% for BP (systolic and 
diastolic); 10% for pulse and 25% for respirations ______ Assess all vital signs ______ Uses stethescope appropriately and places it in the proper position ______ Uses blood pressure cuff appropriately and places it in the proper position 
Lung Sounds

Childbirth (Continued) ___________ 18. Clear the baby’s mouth and nose of body fluids using a bulb syringe.   NOTE: Compress the syringe prior to inserting it in the baby’s mouth or nose.  Avoid contacting 
the back of the mouth with the syringe. ___________ 19. Support the shoulders and head during delivery. ___________ 20. Document the time of delivery of the baby and placenta. Post-partum management ___________ 21. Wrap the baby in a blanket and place the baby on a side with head lowered to allow 
drainage of body fluid from the mouth and nose, and maintain the airway.  Keep baby at the same level as mother’s vagina to prevent blood from returning through the umbilical cord to the placenta. 
One practitioner should: ___________ 22. Wipe mucous from baby’s face with sterile gauze, suction mouth and nose with a bulb syringe.   ___________ 23. Dry the baby with a clean towel and bundle appropriately for weather—keep the head covered. Babies can become hypothermic very quickly. ___________ 24. Provide tactile stimulation including suctioning and drying the baby should stimulate breathing. You may also need to rub the back or flick the soles of the feet. ___________ 25. When the cord pulsation stops, clamp or tie the cord approximately four (4) finger width from the baby.  A second clamp or tie is secured two inches further away from the baby than the initial clamp.  The cord is then cut between the two clamps or ties.  ___________ 26. Determine the baby’s APGAR Score 1 minute and 5 minutes following birth. 
Childbirth (Continued) 

The other practitioner should: 
___________ 27. Not delay transport more than 30 minutes waiting for the placenta. 
___________ 28. (The mother will feel contractions as the placenta prepares to deliver) — Encourage her to push. As the placenta delivers, wrap it in a towel and place it in a plastic bag.  The placenta must be transported to the hospital with the mother.  Never pull the umbilical cord to try to force the placenta to deliver. 
___________ 29. After the placenta has delivered, place a sterile/sanitary napkin over the vaginal opening. 
___________ 30. If excessive bleeding (in excess of 500cc) occurs, massage the abdomen at the fundus of the uterus to help control bleeding. 
___________ 31. Begin transport and notify the hospital as soon as possible.  The newborn should be restrained in an approved safety seat for the transport.

Multiple Births 
Delivery is assisted in the same way as other births with the following considerations: Multiple births have a higher rate of complications than single births. 
____________ 1. Call for assistance and be prepared for more than one resuscitation. NOTE: Consider oxygen application ____________ 2. After delivery of the first infant, when the cord stops pulsating, clamp or tie and cut the umbilical cord. 
____________ 3. When contractions begin again, usually within 5-10 minutes of the first delivery, assist the delivery of the subsequent infant(s) as usual. 
____________ 4. When the cord stops pulsating, clamp or tie and cut the umbilical cord of the second infant. 
____________ 5. Provide maternal care as for a single birth. 
NOTE: Keep in mind that premature or low birth weight babies are common in multiple births. 
____________ 2.  Do not stimulate the baby to breathe before suctioning the oropharynx. 
____________ 3.  Suction as soon as possible. 
____________ 4.  Maintain on open airway. 
____________ 5.  Begin transport and notify the hospital of the presence of meconium immediately. 
Premature Birth Premature births (less than 28 weeks gestation or 5.5 lbs.) have a higher rate of 
complications than full-term births. 
____________ 1. Keep the infant warm.  Make sure to dry and wrap the baby, including the baby’s head, in a blanket. 
NOTE: Consider oxygen application 
____________ 2. Suction as needed. 
____________ 3. Monitor the umbilical cord to assure that there is no bleeding.  If there is bleeding, place an additional clamp on the cord closer to the infant. 
Breech Birth 
____________ 1. Place the mother in a position that removes pressure from the cord (head down and/or pelvis elevated). 
____________ 2. Administer high flow oxygen (15 L/min) to mother. 
____________ 3. Begin transport, notify the hospital immediately, and watch for a prolapsed cord. 
If delivery begins, and the head fails to deliver,  
____________ 4. Place a gloved hand into the patient’s vagina with your palm facing the baby’s face.  Make a V with your index and middle fingers on either side of the baby’s nose.  Push he vaginal wall away from the baby’s face until the head delivers.  Do not hyperextend the baby’s head while pushing the vaginal wall away from the face. If the head does not deliver, transport immediately. Do not attempt to force delivery by pulling on the trunk or legs of the infant.

3. 	
Identify the prescribed dose (“one” or “two” inhalations) for the specific patient and ascertain how many times the patient has already used the inhaler. 

4. 	
Medical direction is required if the patient has self-administered two doses or more (> 2 to 4 inhalations) within a half-hour to your arrival. 

5. 	
If necessary for administration, briefly remove oxygen from the patient. 

6. 	
Have the patient actuate the inhaler (once or twice, according to the patient’s prescription). 

7. 	
As the medication is discharged, have the patient breathe deeply and hold his/her breath as long as it is comfortably possible. 

8. 	
Replace the oxygen onto the patient (if it has been removed) as soon as possible. 

9. 	
Reassess vital sign measurements and the patient’s condition. 

10. 
Contact Medical Command for additional doses. 

11. 
Record the administration. 

12. 
Reassess and prepare patient for transport. 


Side Effects (of which to be aware): 
Hypertension Increased Heart Rate Tremors Vomiting 
Angina Nervousness Nausea Sore Throat 

Dosage: 
Based on patient’s prescription, you may assist a patient with a dose.  This will be one or two inhalations according to the prescription.  Medical direction is required if the patient has selfadministered two doses or more within a half-hour prior to your arrival. 
An EMT or EMT-B may assist with the medication one time prior to on-line medical command. Any subsequent administration requires on-line medical command, unless command is not accessible or is not available.  The EMT or EMT-B shall notify medical command following the administration of the inhaler. 
EMT-Assisted Inhaled Bronchodilator Use: 
The Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH) is providing a list of inhaled bronchodilator drugs with which basic EMTs can assist patients in terms of self-medication. 
Although some persons have expressed concerns that such a list may be considered restrictive or unfeasible to use in an emergency, the overall intent is to encourage EMTs to assist the patient when necessary. This is especially pertinent when the drug may be helpful, but the patient is too ill to either help themselves or simply access the drug. Fortunately, the list is relatively short and can be kept on a small card or pasted into a small booklet such as those often carried by EMS personnel. 
The DOH recognizes that new drugs may be introduced and added to the list over time, i.e., the list needs to be upgraded occasionally. The DOH also recognizes that the list may not be all-inclusive in terms of all prescribed medications that are available. However, since it includes most of the commonly prescribed drugs, the DOH considers this list to be a useful tool and not a restrictive device. In that respect, several principles should be kept in mind: 
Regarding Inhaled Bronchodilator Drugs with which EMTs can Assist the Patient in Self-Medication: 
1. 	
Only short-acting, rapid-onset, beta-2 agonists prescribed by a physician, should be utilized under these circumstances (see list on page 3). 

2. 	
The EMT should follow the protocol for patient-assisted medication unless instructed to do otherwise by a physician. 

3. 	
Long-acting, slower-onset, beta-2 agonists (e.g., Serevent), or “over-the-counter” drugs (e.g., Primatene Mist), or inhaled steroids (e.g., Flovent, Beclovent, Vanceril, Aero-bid, Azmacort), or anti-cholinergics (e.g., Atrovent), or other inhaled compounds (e.g., Intal, Tilade), should not be utilized under these circumstances. 

4. 	
When unsure of the appropriate action, the EMT should contact medical command for further direction.

*Pediatric Guidelines 
Cardiac arrest is less common in infants and children than in adults.  The accuracy and efficiency of AEDs has been reported only for adults with cardiac arrest; the computer algorithms used to analyze cardiac rhythm have been developed and tested with adult rhythms.  In addition, current AEDs use a monophasic or biphasic energy setting >150 joules for the initial shock, and most do not offer a lower setting generally considered suitable for children. 
Therefore, based on body size, the current recommendation is to follow adult BLS guidelines for children aged 8 years and older.  This recommendation reflects the sense that the opportunity to defibrillate VF in a child still should not be missed despite the fact that experience with AEDs in pediatric resuscitation is severely limited.  Evidence suggests that VF in young people is associated with congenital heart problems, drug abuse (e.g., glue sniffing), or drug overdoses.  These patients merit assessment for the presence of VF/VT.  The age cutoff of 8 years is based more on the body size than the cause of cardiac arrest.  It is appropriate to use an AED when a child older than 8 years (or weighing more than 25 kg/55 lbs.) is in cardiac arrest. 
Use of AEDs with infants and children younger than 8 years is not recommended for several reasons.  In most pediatric studies, pulseless VT and VF have been documented in well under 10 percent of all pediatric arrest patients, even when the rhythm was evaluated by first responder's within 7 minutes of collapse.  In infants and children, respiratory arrest is thought to be a common cause of cardiac arrest, and rapid BLS at the scene has been associated with improved survival. Also, there is concern that using current types of countershock delivery systems, energy levels >20-25 joules/kg may cause significant myocardial injury.    
More research is needed on the potential use of AEDs in infants and children to facilitate development of evidence-based
recommendations.

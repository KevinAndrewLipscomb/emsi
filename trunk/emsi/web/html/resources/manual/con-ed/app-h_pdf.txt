SECTION I - APPLICANT INFORMATION 
Complete requested applicant identification information. 

SECTION II - COURSE INFORMATION SUMMARY 
Provide the required information identifying the program for which you are requesting continuing education credit. 

SECTION III - PROGRAM INFORMATION 
The Length of the Course is the scheduled time of the program in hours. 
The Actual Class time is the time actually spent in the educational experience. Lunch and break time must be excluded from the course scheduled time. 
This course relates to the scope of practice should be completed to indicate the practitioner level of the course for which you are requesting continuing education credit (check the appropriate box).  Complete the number of hours to the nearest half-hour that relate to Basic Life Support (BLS) and Advanced Life Support (ALS). These hours should include all hours from your course that relate to the National Standard Curricula as approved by Pennsylvania, even if they are not direct patient care issues. If there are scope of practice issues….or even if you are unsure if they are issues….record them here. It will be reviewed at the Regional Council and the EMS Office. 
The hours related to direct patient care education at the Basic Life Support (BLS) level and at the Advanced Life Support (ALS) level should be listed on the appropriate lines. Direct patient care is considered care (including assessment) of an individual who is believed to be sick, injured, wounded or otherwise incapacitated and helpless and in need of immediate medical attention. It includes assessment and care provided both physically and emotionally, but does not include items such as response planning, legal aspects, communications, documentation, hazardous materials, emergency vehicle operations (EVOC), or other operational issues. 
The Intended Audience area must have all applicable boxes marked. 
Examples include: 
AHA ACLS courses - EMTs may not be recognized as AHA ACLS providers so this course 
is intended and credit given for EMT-P and PHRN providers. American College of Surgeons PHTLS courses - First Responders may not be recognized as 
PHTLS providers. 
The Subject of course should indicate the course content. Titles are sometimes not reflective of the subject matter. If the course or seminar covers multiple topics indicate the predominant theme of the program.

Preparatory  Anatomy & physiology, pathophysiology, life span development,  
lifting & moving

08/29/01 
Course Objectives/Announcement - Attach information that identifies the objectives of the program attended. This can be the course announcement, brochure, advertisement, etc., that identifies the program’s purpose. 
Course Objectives - May be the same as the NSC objectives.  In this instance, it is not necessary to list the objectives again. You may note, “Course Objectives - Same as NSC objectives.”  More commonly, course objectives will be related to, but different from, the NSC referenced objectives. The course objectives are typically the same for all students and are not designated to specific certification levels. For the ABC rigid splint course noted above, course objectives would be more specific than the NSC objectives related to splinting. One course objective would be related to NSC objectives for the three certification levels.  The course objective, “Demonstrate the application of the ABC rigid splint,” would relate to NSC objectives FR Lesson 10, EMT 5-3.11, and EMT-P 3-1.125 and would be listed as one course objective. 
National Standard Curriculum (NSC) Objectives referenced by curriculum(s) and objective number(s) - Each NSC curriculum has numbered objectives.  Those that apply to the course should be 
reference.  
Example:  A two-hour program designed to familiarize prehospital personnel with the new  
ABC rigid splint might include the following:  
FR  Lesson 10 objectives  
EMT  5-3.1, 5-3.2, 5-3.4 through 5-3.8, and 5-3.11  
EMT-P  3-1.76 through 3-1.80, 3-1.82 and 3-1.125  

There is variation in how the curriculum identifies objective numbers.  Reference numbers only need to be provided to reduce paperwork exchange. This will facilitate accurate and timely assignment of hours. 
Content outline including time allotment - Attach the program agenda or outline that adequately identifies the information that was taught in the course with the time allocated for each topic. This information may be included in the same document identified above or may be a separate lesson plan, student handout, etc. 
Evaluation mechanism(s) and successful completion - Attach a copy of the test(s) administered if available. If not, attach your statement that indicates how you were evaluated. For example, “A written test was given and we were required to score an 80%.” 
Verification of successful completion - Attach a copy of your certificate of completion, transcript, program completion letter, etc.

<h1>OSHA411 yahoogroup</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>This public yahoogroup is a forum for the exchange of information regarding
  OSHA activity affecting Pennsylvania EMS agencies.</p>
  <p>As of May of 2003, such OSHA activity has drawn attention from several
  stakeholders. It is evident that stakeholders in reactive and proactive
  stances are encountering a dearth of useful, authoritative,
  &quot;actionable&quot; information. This yahoogroup was created to support
  fast-cycle collaboration on the topic.</p>
  <p>It's anticipated that this group will expand rapidly upon creation; that
  authoritative information will be discovered, shared, archived, compiled, and
  converted into FAQ form; that a critical mass of topical awareness will
  eventually be achieved; that the need for this yahoogroup will thereafter
  diminish, and the yahoogroup will be deactivated.</p>
  <p>Topics include, but are not limited to: Where is OSHA conducting
  inspections? How are they choosing their &quot;targets&quot;? What are they
  looking for? Do their requirements meet the &quot;sanity test&quot;? If not,
  what can we do? If so, how can we achieve compliance? Etc, etc.</p>
  <p>The yahoogroup was established and is moderated by Kevin Lipscomb,
  Assistant Executive Director, EMSI, as a way of efficiently managing the
  administrative load generated by the high degree of interest in the topic.
  Unless otherwise noted, EMSI does not have any official position regarding
  this forum's subject matter.
